Generative AI and You
Integrated Annual Report 2023-24



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 3

We barely saw it happen. AI walking into our lives. Through 
the ads that follow us on social media. The personalized 
pick of movies and shows. Our cars. The maps helping us 
navigate. Right there in our hands – our super-powerful 
phones. And now, it’s happening again. This time with 
generative AI. In the form of handy tools – like ChatGPT, 
MetaAI and Stable Diffusion – that pique our imagination, 
and stoke our curiosity.

Generative AI technology’s path into enterprises too has 
been just as accelerated and enthusiastic, supported by 
an exponential increase in investments. While almost 
every enterprise has started working with generative 
AI, their struggles with data readiness and concerns 
around regulatory compliance are just as real. A common 
acknowledgment is that very few of the gen AI pilots, when 
considered at scale, promise to deliver tangible business 
value. In the months to follow, we believe, some ongoing 
AI pilots will scale to strategic AI programs that will then 
help pave the way for AI-led business transformations.

Our clients, across industries, are looking to solve tough 
business challenges with generative AI in ways that 
produce measurable outcomes for them. For example, 
supporting and personalizing customer interactions, 
bringing greater efficiencies to marketing and sales, 

improving the quality of code, and even enhancing 
personal and organizational productivity. They also clearly 
see that the advent of generative AI, with potential for 
more pervasive automation, will accelerate the pace of 
workforce transformation. Talent, across functions, will 
need support to imbibe new skills, and some will even prep 
for entirely new jobs that didn’t exist before. Generative AI, 
if embraced responsibly, could drive productivity growth 
and support a more sustainable, inclusive world.

Embracing AI responsibly also means keeping track of 
emerging AI regulations across countries and jurisdictions 
while ensuring compliance. Existing processes, policies, 
guidelines, and tooling will need to be continuously 
reviewed and enhanced to cover model assurance, model 
security, bias, fairness, explainability, reproducibility, 
training data privacy, safety and alignment, IP/contractual 
risks and sustainability impact too. We are factoring 
it all in as we engineer enterprise-scale generative AI 
developments for our clients. You’ll come across some 
examples right here in this Integrated Annual Report. But 
what we hope you also won’t miss is to see how you too 
can navigate your next as generative AI paves the path 
forward for us all, and how Infosys can be the trusted 
partner on that journey into the future.

Gen AI: Ushering in the next era of business

Microsoft Corporation is a technology company that 
aspires to empower every person and every organization 
on the planet to achieve more.

As a vocal advocate for the game-changing potential 
of artificial intelligence, Microsoft was eager to harness 
the power of AI, especially generative AI, to heighten 
their operational agility. This meant reengineering their 
operations analytics platform for better quality, faster 
response, and support. The platform is a trusted resource 
for several thousand users at Microsoft, offering insights 
and transactions support to manage their business 
operations across commercial, OEM, and partner channels. 
To amplify and transform the platform with generative AI, 
Microsoft teamed up with Infosys.

Infosys brought the capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service 
and GitHub Copilot to help solve this challenging problem. 
They also brought best practices for leveraging generative 
AI technologies for code generation and development 
support. Infosys used these techniques and started to 
reengineer the platform, factoring in user feedback 

while simultaneously addressing pitfalls preemptively 
and making efficiency projections. The aim was to 
transform the platform to meet changing user needs at 
a revolutionary rate. The outcome was a whopping 35% 
reduction in development effort and a 24% reduction in 
test-case generation and code review time. In fact, the 
platform was ready to deliver on Microsoft’s operational 
aspirations six months ahead of schedule!

The renewed operations platform delivers never-before-
seen on-time, on-demand intelligence for users with 
hugely reduced data latency and cost across the 150+ 
reports of operational insights that the business counts 
on. The new generative AI-powered knowledge repository 
enables the platform’s support team to provide quicker 
responses to queries, resulting in an 18% reduction in 
support ticket volume. This newfound agility, along 
with the self-service capabilities added to the platform, 
has resulted in a sharp increase in internal customer 
satisfaction.

Microsoft Corporation: Transforming platform engineering. 
Transforming operations

“Successful operations are all about effective support for the business, firmly 
grounding the core technology to make that possible, and being able to pivot with 
agility to meet changing market needs. Generative AI, Azure OpenAI Service, and 
GitHub Copilot, in the hands of capable Infosys engineers, helped us to transform and 
modernize our operations analytics platform to be able to meet the demands of our 
business while saving time, money, and delighting users with the experience.” 

– Jonathan Chromy, Principal SWE Manager, Microsoft

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 7

Danske Bank is a Nordic bank, the largest retail bank in 
Denmark, with over 5 million retail customers. 

In the summer of 2023, the Bank announced its Forward 
’28 strategy to strengthen the organization and create a 
more focused business trajectory to exceed its financial 
targets. With the maturing of generative AI, Danske Bank 
was quick to see its potential to revolutionize their industry 
and transform the way their own company operated, to 
increase efficiency and productivity, reduce costs, and 
open up new opportunities for growth. They were keen 
to start to explore a custom GPT indexed with their own 
business content to automate repetitive tasks and provide 
instant responses to tactical pursuits, freeing up human 
staff to focus on more strategic objectives.

Infosys responded with a plan to help Danske Bank 
set up an A-team and the appropriate generative AI 
technology to build a secure, ethical-by-design chat-
based assistant – DanskeGPT. The intent was to prototype 
and scale a solution to accelerate personal productivity, 
first in a sandboxed environment for experimentation, 

while maintaining an abundance of caution that provides 
the guardrails to manage ethical and practical safeguards 
for issues like AI hallucinations. Microsoft’s Open AI services 
in Azure provided the foundation. From start to pilot, the 
solution was ready in about six weeks, and soon scaled for 
ethical and safe use for about 3,000 users. 

Today, Danske Bank’s entire employee base is harnessing 
DanskeGPT’s capabilities to assist them in their everyday 
activities – already seeing a 10-15% boost in productivity 
in some areas. Team Infosys continues to work, enhancing 
DanskeGPT with internal data, to deliver for Danske Bank 
new content, and enable new process improvements 
through effective ways of employing this flexible assistant. 
The team is also helping the Bank to quickly identify the 
parts of their business where the technology could have 
the most immediate impact. The effort also includes 
strategic moves to assemble a cross-functional team, 
including data science practitioners, legal experts, and 
business leaders, to scale the continued AI-powered 
transformation of Danske Bank.

Danske Bank: Scaling assistive technology organization-wide

“We are rapidly building capability to tackle hundreds of AI-powered ideas to 
drive productivity across our business units. From better insights and reporting to 
identifying risks and vulnerabilities, while improving our customer and company 
outcomes, we are prioritizing and delivering services into the bank with support 
from Infosys.’’ 

– Jan den Boer, Head Strategic Sourcing, Senior Vice President, Danske Bank

Currys is an international omnichannel retailer of 
technology products and services, operating online and 
across 720 stores in six countries, helping customers enjoy 
amazing technology, however they choose to shop. 

As the cost-of-living pressures escalated in the UK, 
Currys wanted to optimize its sales and service process 
for greater efficacy, so it was better able to deliver more 
value to its customers. Currys also clearly saw the need 
to be as efficient as possible through these efforts so it 
could sustain the program, increase productivity, and 
share the savings made with its customers. It was quick to 
see the advantage to be gained from using AI to execute 
on its pricing, personalization, e-commerce and service 
strategies. 

Currys partnered with Infosys to build an ML- and AI-based 
price recommendation engine, co-developing decision-
support capabilities and internal tooling, yielding strong 
predictive pricing performance. These recommendations 
are driving sustained profitable sales for Currys through 

better-adapted and optimized omnichannel pricing. With 
e-commerce bringing in 45% of Currys UK&I revenues, 
Infosys also simultaneously worked with Currys to develop 
an ML- and AI-powered online conversion analytics engine 
to unearth insights into customer journeys that impact 
conversion.

Currys is now advancing its exploration into the realm of 
generative AI. In tandem with Infosys, Currys is undertaking 
multiple programs to test and learn:

• Gen AI-powered tools to query and summarize lengthy 
product documentation to support internal teams on 
their information needs

• A smart repairs and services assistant to guide on simple 
fixes, with the potential to reduce false returns and call 
volumes

• Sentiment analysis and summarization based on 
customer feedback from surveys, to guide identification 
of opportunities to improve customer service 
experience.

Currys: Driving step-change evolution of sales ROI

“We exist to help everyone enjoy amazing technology. As a tech retailer, it’s in our DNA 
to embrace and harness new tech to improve the customer experience and help them 
choose, afford and enjoy new tech. With the combination of shared values, a love of 
technology and deep expertise in G(AI), Infosys is a natural partner for Currys.”

– Ian Dawson, Global Business Solutions Director, Currys

LG Electronics is leading the global market in smart home 
appliances and consumer electronics.

From a strategic standpoint of the brand, LG Electronics 
makes a solid and uncompromising promise to create a 
better life for their customers. They articulate it succinctly 
– Life’s Good. The company truly understands the power 
of harnessing cutting-edge technology to deliver on their 
promise. In fact, the company redefined AI as “Affectionate 
Intelligence,” with a conviction that AI can foster more 
empathetic and attentive customer experience. In fact, 
leveraging the company’s vast repository of user data, the 
LG AI Brain forecasts customers’ needs based on user-
product interactions and contextual learning.

Having made significant progress on its AI journey, LG 
Electronics USA approached Infosys to implement a 
reliable and cost-efficient AI solution for automated 
consumer insights for digital channel and customer 
sentiment analysis that helps to increase digital sales. 
Traditionally, businesses grapple with fragmented data 
sources and often rely on costly third-party tools for 
customer insights. Infosys revolutionized the approach 
by creating a unified data architecture to seamlessly 
integrate disparate data sources, including CRM systems, 

digital marketing platforms, competitor data, social media 
platforms, customer feedback channels, and transactional 
databases. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies and best 
practices, the data fabric solution served as the foundation 
for our automated consumer insights initiative.

Infosys then conducted a Proof of Concept (POC) for 
customer sentiment analysis, leveraging the capabilities 
of our newly implemented data fabric by implementing 
a generative AI-powered sentiment analysis solution 
on Google Cloud, seamlessly integrating diverse data 
sources. This included data from sources such as Bazaar 
Voice, Intellytics, VoiceBot, ChatBot, and audio files. The 
generative AI solution included Chirp for speech-to-
text conversion and Text Bison for sentiment analysis. 
Scalability, efficiency, and compliance with industry 
standards for data handling and model operationalization 
were seamlessly managed. The solution delivers up to 50% 
greater efficiencies with automated consumer insights. The 
solution is now planned to be moved into production.

LG Electronics USA, like Infosys, is acutely aware of their 
responsibility to deploy AI in an ethical manner. The 
company aims to develop AI systems that benefit all users, 
promote safe behavior and deliver delight to customers.

LG Electronics: Gaining from automated consumer insights 
for increasing digital sales

“Companies, like our own, are already trying to stay ahead by exploiting gen AI 
models in order to improve customer experience and harness exponential business 
growth. The next step for us will be to differentiate ourselves with the value that 
gen AI can deliver along with our own data and systems. There are significant 
opportunities for companies that want to push ahead with gen AI and we want 
to be recognized as a leader in this space. Infosys with their deep expertise and 
investments in gen AI is a natural partner of choice for us to help achieve our goals.’’

– Sujatha Krishnan, Senior Director, Head of Data Solutions, LG Electronics USA

Chairman’s message
Performance overview

We are into the second year of the generative AI 
revolution, and some clarity is beginning to emerge from 
the noise and babble of the last 18 months. The initial 
hyperventilation of AI doomerism and the risk of human 
extinction by AI advances like Artificial General Intelligence 
(AGI) has quietened down. People have accepted that, like 
any other general-purpose technology be it electricity, 
nuclear energy, the internet or even a discovery like fire, 
gen AI has enormous potential for good when explored 
and advanced within the guardrails of responsibility. 
Besides, many of the doomsday prophets pleading for 
extensive AI regulation have revealed themselves to be just 
protectionists who want to limit the fruits of gen AI to a 
few companies and investors.

It is also clear that there won’t be a scenario where we’ll 
have ‘one model to rule them all’. Every day brings new 
advances in large language models from a dizzying set 
of actors all pushing for greater innovation. These range 
from very large models which need massive computing 
infrastructure to small ones that can run locally on the 
phone. The real power of AI will come from configuring all 
the different models and tools to get the best solutions. 
This is not very different from previous generations of 
technology. What’s more, the rise of powerful open-source 
AI models has accelerated the deployment of AI to solve 
tough business and societal challenges. Although there 
could be concentration risk in the hardware and cloud 
infrastructure space, as we move into actual use cases, a 
thousand flowers will bloom. 

It is more than evident that enterprise AI will be markedly 
different from consumer AI. The manifestations of 
consumer AI will be packaged in wondrous ways to make 
life easier and more productive for millions of people. New 
ways of conducting search; agents that help plan work and 
leisure; intuitive interfaces that can serve up what’s needed 
and reason with users; even speech recognition that 
understands the nuances of dialects and colloquialisms. 
Not unlike the smartphone that brought the magic of apps 
and touchscreen to billions, consumer AI will push the 
envelope of usability, convenience, and accessibility for 
everyone. 

Enterprise AI, on the other hand, requires a root and 
branch surgery of the complex and multigeneration 
technology (both legacy and modern), that lie within firms. 
The AI models themselves will become commodities. The 
challenge will be to orchestrate the extensive data inside 

What’s next for the generative AI revolution
the corporation, both structured and unstructured, explicit 
and tacit, in a way that it is consumable by AI. The quality of 
output needs to be managed to ensure correct and factual 
responses and insights with no hallucinations. Given 
that the leaderboard of technologies will be changing 
at a bewildering pace, enterprises will have to ‘future 
proof’ their AI infrastructure with suitable abstractions 
to be able to switch models easily and not be trapped in 
a technological cul de sac. As various nations come up 
with different ways of regulating AI, global companies 
will have to build their AI applications in a way that they 
are compliant in every country. While application can 
be trialled on very large models, deployment will be on 
narrow transformers, trained on relevant enterprise data, 
fully secure and efficient in their inferencing. Enterprises 
will need both an AI foundry for experimentation and an 
AI factory for scaling up. AI architecture must facilitate an 
approach that combines the analytical thinking of the left 
brain with the intuitive approach of the right brain. The 
constraint of resources will require a transparent way of 
identifying the highest value AI use cases. AI must amplify 
the potential of every human being in the enterprise.

Firms in the business of enabling digital transformation, 
like Infosys, will be in the eye of the storm. Software 
development will be rapidly automated and amplified. We 
have to seize the productivity benefits and share them with 
our customers. The productivity gains from automation, 
must lead to talent redeployment in new areas with new 
opportunities. We must learn from applying AI to ourselves, 
be it in creating an AI-first enterprise or in accelerating the 
massive talent amplification that’s now needed. We are 
already doing it, at Infosys, by applying Infosys Topaz to 
transform all the services we offer to become AI-first and to 
accelerate business value using generative AI technologies. 
We are certain that change will have to be embraced – not 
resisted.

Above all, the gen AI revolution presents an unrivaled 
opportunity. The flux of change as the whole technological 
landscape is being reset will create many large openings. 
Packaged solutions will be reimagined, and we will see a 
resurgence of custom-built solutions that must be enabled 
with new types of AI building blocks. The puck is clearly 
and quickly moving to a place where the balance of 
advantage will be with Infosys.

Letter to the Shareholder
Performance overview

Dear shareholder,

Infosys is the leading company in AI and generative 
AI today.

We are working on several projects with clients to help 
them benefit from generative AI. These projects are in 
software engineering, process optimization, customer 
support, advisory services, as well as sales and marketing. 
They are helping our clients reduce cost, improve service 
quality, connect with their customers and drive growth. We 
are working with market-leading open access and closed 
large language models. Our work in AI and generative AI is 
available to our clients using Infosys Topaz.

Enterprise AI is built using the data within enterprises. 
Here, our approach of narrow transformers, working 
deeply with enterprise data, brings significant benefit to 
our clients.

In addition, we have augmented our services with 
generative AI and developed playbooks for each of our 
offerings. We are among the first IT services companies 
globally to achieve ISO 42001:2023 certification, which 
is a testament to our commitment to excellence in AI 
management. We were ranked as a leader in AI services by 
seven out of eight leading analysts.

Infosys Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to 
resonate with our clients. We work closely with the major 
public cloud providers and on private cloud programs for 
our clients. Cloud, along with data, is the foundation for AI 
and generative AI.

Data within enterprises, from their customer experiences, 
from their employee and supplier interactions, becomes 
critical foundation for successful generative AI deployment. 
Our strength in data, as a result of our digital leadership, 
is helping ensure our clients are ready to leverage the 
opportunity presented by generative AI.

During the year, our relentless focus on execution enabled 
us to deliver growth and operating margin resilience. 
We generated US$2.9 billion of free cash flow. We 
worked closely with our clients on their cost, efficiency, 
automation, and consolidation programs to generate 
US$17.7 billion of large deals, the highest we have had 
annually, which showcases the relevance of our service 
offerings for clients. 

Over the past five years, from financial year 2020 to 
2024 we have returned 85% of free cash flow to you, our 

shareholders, as per our capital allocation policy (the 
final dividend of `20 per share and the special dividend 
of `8 per share for the financial year 2024 has been 
recommended by the Board for shareholder approval) 
which is a return of US$2.3 billion to shareholders.

We recruited nearly 11,900 college graduates in the year 
and ended the year with over 3,17,000 employees. Our 
attrition reduced to 12.6%. We trained over 2,50,000 
employees on AI skills. Our focus on gender diversity 
continues with about 39% of our workforce consisting of 
women employees.

During the year, we were recognized as the only Indian 
firm in the top 100 of TIME Magazine’s list of World’s Best 
Companies of 2023. We were also recognized as a Top 100 
brand globally by Kantar Brand Z and the fastest growing 
IT services brand over a 5-year period by Brand Finance.

We remain committed to the communities we live and 
operate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we 
continue to create positive impact in healthcare, education, 
sustainability, and women empowerment. The projects we 
undertake help to provide equitable support to those most 
in need of new opportunities. Our Springboard initiative 
continues to help build digital skills by providing free 
learning programs to 7.9 million people around the world.

Thanks to our clients for their incredible trust in us and 
for helping us become the leading AI-first, cloud-first, and 
digital-first company.

Thanks to our 3,17,000 employees for their enormous 
contribution to making our clients successful.

Thanks to our Board for their guidance and direction on 
our strategic approach.

With changing technology, our clients are keen to leverage 
these advances for their customers, operations, and 
employees. With our leadership in AI and generative AI, 
cloud, and digital, along with our diverse workforce around 
the world, we are well-positioned to support our clients 
today and in the future.

As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the changes in 
technology and how these can make a positive impact on 
the world and our clients.

With my warmest regards,

Sd/-

Our business context
Approaching value creation

Technology continues to transform 
businesses in every industry 
around the world in a profound and 
fundamental way. In fiscal 2024, 
AI, including generative AI, 5G, 
Low Code No Code and quantum 
computing shaped the future of 
industries. From new AI architectures 
to precision manufacturing, this 
year, we are tackling some of the 
hardest challenges across industries. 
Responsible business approaches, 
including embracing ESG, continue 
to gain traction. We continued to 
witness businesses attempting to 
reimagine their cost structures, 
increase business resilience and 
agility, personalize experiences 
for customers and employees, 
and launch new and disruptive 
products and services. Enterprises are 
leveraging AI to extend the value of 
existing investments and, in parallel, 
transform and future-proof their 
business. The need for professionals 
who are highly skilled in both 
traditional and digital technology 
areas is driving businesses to 
build strategic technology and 
IT partnerships to realize their 
transformation journeys. 

We see AI across industries, fine-
tune the necessities of specialized 
domains and tasks.

The future of the technology industry 
continues to be shaped by the 
following trends:

• Focus on generative AI

• Demand for IT services with 
growth pockets emerging in areas 
like cloud, cybersecurity, IoT and 
immersive technologies.

• Focus on cost takeouts to 
deal with the uncertain global 
environment.

• Increase in enterprise spending 
on hybrid, multi-cloud / AI-led 
transformation.

• Intense competition for talent as 
enterprises embrace new ways 
of working amid scarcity of niche 
digital skills. 

• Continued focus on 
Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) as a strategic 
theme for all enterprise 
stakeholders.

Intense competition marks the 
delivery of traditional services in 
a rapidly changing marketplace, 
especially with the emergence of 
new players in niche technology 
areas. Infosys’ industry expertise, end 
to-end service capability and digital 
solutions, ability to scale, established 
platforms, superior quality and 
process execution, distributed agile 
global delivery model, experienced 
management team, talented 
professionals and track record are 
often cited as clear differentiators.

Responsibility and 
responsiveness

As an early proponent of responsible 
business, Infosys has incorporated 
ESG goals into the entirety of its 
operations. Infosys ESG Vision 2030 
articulates the Company’s ambitions 
to balance success as a business with 
unwavering focus on exemplary 
governance and responsiveness to 
the needs of stakeholders. Primary 
stakeholders include investors, 

customers, employees, suppliers, 
communities, government and 
regulatory bodies. The expectations 
of the Company’s investors include 
sustainable business performance 
and financial returns; customers 
want long-term business value and 
innovative solutions; employees are 
keen for career opportunities, health 
& safety and learning & development, 
suppliers look forward to long-
term partnerships; communities 
seek improved livelihoods and 
access to healthcare and education, 
while governments and regulators 
expect good governance and legal 
compliance. Infosys continues to 
deliver value to all its stakeholders 
through prudent and responsible 
business decisions, services and 
operations.

During fiscal 2024, various risk 
management initiatives were 
undertaken to ensure the smooth 
delivery of services to our clients, 
transparent communication with 
all stakeholders, fulfillment of our 
social responsibility while ensuring 
employee safety and health by 
strengthening risk management 
program and enhancing the risk 
culture. While the Company tracks 
several risks to its business, the top 
risks and mitigation, along with 
emerging risks, are available in the 
Risk management report.

markets across the world. Our strong

income from short and long-term 
investments, among others. 

Our primary sources of liquidity 
are cash and cash equivalents and 
the cash flow generated from our 
operations. We continue to remain 
debt-free, and we maintain adequate 

cash to meet our operational 
and strategic requirements and 
unforeseen events while also earning 
sufficient returns.

Infosys’ climate commitments

 • As a part of Infosys ESG Vision 2030, we have committed to maintaining 
carbon neutrality across scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions every year 

 • Signatory to the Climate Pledge, with the ultimate goal of a Net Zero planet 
by 2040

 • Our goals are aligned to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

Climate action strategy
We are working diligently towards 
this goal and have built our carbon 
neutral program on three pillars – 

Energy efficiency
To reduce emissions

Renewable energy
To avoid emissions

Carbon offsets
To offset emissions

Carbon neutrality 
Infosys is carbon neutral for the fifth 
year in a row. As part of our energy 
efficiency efforts we continue to 
push the envelope when it comes 
to creating efficient workplaces, 
by ensuring efficient design 
and operation of our buildings. 
The stringent environmental 
performance criteria not only apply 
to our own buildings but are also a 
prerequisite for leased offices. Today, 
we have over 29.6 million sq.ft. of 
buildings with the highest level of 
green building certification. 

Renewable energy
Renewable energy plays a crucial role 
in addressing the urgent challenges 
of climate change, energy security 
and sustainable development. Infosys 
was an early mover in renewable 
energy, adopting solar PV plants 
in our campuses way back in 2009 
itself. Today, we have a total capacity 
of 60.2 MWp of solar PV across 
Infosys campuses, and a large solar 
park situated in Sira, about 140 km 
from Bengaluru. We have engaged 
continuously with many state 
governments to enable favorable 

Carbon neutral for  
5 years in a row

policies and green power through 
DISCOMs. Infosys has not purchased 
any renewable energy certificates till 
date. We get 67.52% of electricity for 
our India operations from renewable 
sources.

Carbon offsets
Our focus on high social impact 
carbon offset projects helps us 
to maintain carbon neutrality. 
The projects not only benefit the 
environment but also improve 
health, boost livelihoods, improve 
digital literacy, and help in creating 
rural jobs. Our unique offset program 
is certified to the highest level (Gold 
Standard) in terms of social impact, 
authenticity, and transparency.

This year, through our biogas 
projects, we extended additional 
units of biogas to farmers in the 
Bagalkote region of Karnataka. We 
continued to benefit more than 
2,64,000 rural families and created 
more than ~3,900 rural jobs through 
our 10 running projects in the states 
of Maharashtra, Meghalaya and 
Rajasthan.

Advocacy for climate action
Infosys published a book 
chronicling our efforts in creating 
super-efficient buildings, thereby 
minimizing environmental impact. 
The book titled Pioneering Net 
Zero Buildings – The Infosys Journey 
(https://www.infosys.com/about/
corporate-responsibility/documents/
pioneering-net-zero-buildings.
pdf ) was released on September 
11, 2023, by Prof. Amory Lovins, 
American writer, energy advisor 
physicist and Chairman Emeritus of 
the Rocky Mountain Institute. The 
unique methodology, disruptive 
technologies and new benchmarks 
in building design, captured in the 
book, are expected to guide and 

inspire companies, policymakers, 
academia, and other stakeholders in 
the industry.

Water stewardship
At Infosys, we understand that water 
is essential for life, ecosystems and 
economic prosperity. As demand for 
water increases due to increasing 
population, urbanization and climate 
change, it is more crucial than ever 
to prioritize responsible water 
management. As a signatory to the 
CEO Water Mandate, we commit to 
enhancing our operational water 
conservation procedures and 
expanding our community outreach. 
Infosys’ strategy to reduce water 
demand, recycle 100% wastewater 
and focus on rainwater harvesting 
have resulted in significant reduction 
in our water intensity. In addition 
to the 400 deep recharge wells and 
40 lakes across our campuses, we 
continue to look for innovative ways 
and solutions to reduce our water 
demand and use recycled water 
more effectively. 

Lake rejuvenation

Infosys’ water stewardship efforts 
include lake rejuvenation projects 
and increasing water holding 
capacity of lakes by 10 billion liters in 
the next five years. In fiscal 2024, we 
rejuvenated five lakes in Bengaluru 
enhancing the water holding 
capacity by about 5 billion liters, in 
collaboration with local partners, 
to improve water availability in 
the communities in which Infosys 
operates. Additionally, the lake 
rejuvenation projects created 
much-needed lung spaces for the 
communities, thereby having a 
positive impact on people’s health.

Waste management
Our efforts in waste management 
involves implementing strategies 
to minimize waste generation, 
maximize recovery and promote a 
circular economy. 

We seek to uphold our ambition 
of zero waste to landfills through 
active minimization combined with 
technology investment in recycling 
and streamlining systems and 
processes.

In fiscal 2024, three of our India 
campuses in Bengaluru, Chennai 
and Pune received True Zero Waste 
Platinum certifications from Green 
Business Certification Inc. (GBCI).

Decarbonizing our supply 
chain
Mitigating climate change requires 
timely and decisive action from all 
stakeholders. To meet our ambitious 
targets on climate, we expect our 
suppliers to align with our goals and 
join climate action efforts.

As part of our efforts to decarbonize 
our supply chain, we identified 
suppliers representing a large part 
of our capex spend and invested 
in training and capacity building 
for them. This effort included in-
person training sessions covering 
topics including climate change, 
importance of disclosures, 
maintaining and improving data 
capture methodologies, and 
emission monitoring and calculation 
techniques applicable to the 
organization. Apart from this, Infosys 
also supported a few suppliers 
through one-on-one interactions 
and training in this domain. We also 
launched a platform for suppliers 
to disclose their climate-related 
information to help them in 
benchmarking and improving their 
performance.

Innovative climate 
measures 
Infosys is a pioneer in implementing 
innovative solutions to achieve 
reduction in energy and water. From 
implementing the first radiant cooled 
office building in India in 2010, 
constructing the largest prefabricated 
office building in India in 2019, to 
integrating art and science to design 
one of our most efficient buildings 
in 2023, we have demonstrated that 
innovation is essential to achieve 
transformational savings. 

Some of our innovative climate 
measures to create sustainable 
infrastructure include:

• Radiant cooling system, which is 
about 50% more efficient than 
regular air-conditioning and 
ensures healthier spaces too

• Retroshade device, which allows 
fully-glazed buildings to adopt 
external shading to effectively cut 
off direct sun and heat

• Water from air conditioning 
systems (condensate), is collected 
in a separate tank and utilized in 
cooling towers for air conditioning, 
saving water and energy.

• Other measures like data-driven 
design, use of technology for 
design optimization, climate 
responsive architecture, use 
of systems adapted to local 

conditions, high-efficiency 
equipment and continuous 
monitoring at granular level for 
building performance parameters 
remotely.

High-performance  
green buildings 
Our green buildings are a testimony 
to our commitment to minimize 
impact on the environment even 
while building world-class facilities. 
We have about 29.6 mn sq.ft. of 
the highest level of green building 
certification but the differentiator 
is that we ensure the building 
performance is maintained through 
accurate monitoring, thereby making 
our buildings truly green.

Workplace transformation
Infosys embarked on workplace 
transformation with new design 
principles for a reimagined office 
catering to the new normal. Our 
new design focuses on health and 
wellbeing, productivity, social 
connect and inclusiveness, while 
also ensuring environmental 
sustainability. 

Additionally, as part of our strategy 
to distribute economic growth, tap 
into diverse talent pools, contain the 
explosive growth of tier 1 cities, and 
make it convenient for employees 
based in tier 2 and tier 3 cities in 
India to come to office, we have 
set up offices in Hubballi, Indore, 
Nagpur, Coimbatore, Noida and 
Visakhapatnam. We also opened 
offices in Kolkata and Navi Mumbai 
this year. 

Green IT
InfosysIT has embedded sustainable 
practices across the lifecycles of 
service design, operations and 
disposal of IT assets. 

Data center efficiency

InfosysIT has taken up data center 
modernization as a strategic 
initiative. Density-optimized 
hyperscale platforms have 
been deployed to deliver high-
density server virtualization and 
consolidation across the enterprise. 
The hyperscale private cloud 
platforms provide cloud-scale agility 
and enables efficient resource 
pooling and utilization. This initiative 
has delivered significant power 
savings and drastically reduced 
the total cost of ownership for the 
organization. 

InfosysIT has made focused 
investment on Data Center 
Infrastructure Management (DCIM) 

tools to get accurate visibility across 
the entire data center IT and facility 
stack. DCIM provides environmental 
(temperature, humidity, air flow), 
power (at the device, rack, zone and 
data center level) and cooling data. 
This information can be used to alert 
the Management when thresholds 
are exceeded, reducing repair time 
and increasing availability. Data 
center standards are revised with a 
focus on delivering industry-leading 
PUE and will be integrated with DCIM 
through Smart PDUs for providing 
a unified view of IT and facility 
subsystems.

We have modernized our enterprise 
storage platform to be energy-
efficient. We provide around 1.8PB 
of storage capacity for employees, 
projects, and internal requirements 
on all flash storage with fabric pool 
and storage grid technology. 

We introduced Hybrid cloud storage 
which is helping us in creating 
savings compared to on-premise 
data center while providing high 
availability.

Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code is a 
transformational initiative towards 
enabling continuous deployment 
and integration, and touch-less 
management of the life cycle of 
infrastructure components. This 
methodology overcomes the 
traditional challenges such as growing 
scale of infrastructure, elastic demand, 
speed and consistency of deployment, 
rapid disaster recovery, and the 
interdependency between teams. 

AIOps-powered digital operations

InfosysIT has deployed AIOps 
platform with a wide range of 
capabilities – like algorithmic noise 
reduction, anomaly detection, 
root cause analysis, and context-

based notification. InfosysIT 
digital operations provides unified 
observability cutting across 
infrastructure and application stack, 
in addition to capacity usage and 
cost analysis. It also offers the ability 
to ingest large volumes of data 
originating from all areas of the 
infrastructure and application, and 
analyze it using AI and ML algorithms 
to identify areas of remediation and 
optimization.

PolyCloud and OneStop

We have introduced the OneStop 
unified provisioning platform 
for endpoints, clouds, software, 
and tools. The OneStop platform 
lets project managers request IT 
hardware and software in advance, 
enabling new hires to be productive 
on Day One. The IT Genie intuitive 
app in the laptop helps users 
self-configure basic applications, 
reducing interactions with the IT 
Support team.

The PolyCloud digital backplane 
provides an abstraction of managed 
private clouds and public cloud 
services, including GPU instances for 
AI workloads, empowering full stack 
developers to drive AI-first enterprise 
initiatives.

Public cloud adoption

Majority of internal IT applications 
have been moved to public cloud 
infrastructure. All employees have 
access to the cloud-based platform 
for collaboration like messaging, 
presence, video, and other 
requirements. Additionally, they now 
have cloud-based unified internet 
access and secure private access.

Capital Allocation Policy 
Effective from financial year 2025, the Company expects to 
continue its policy of returning approximately 85% of the 
free cash flow cumulatively over a five-year period through a 
combination of semi-annual dividends and / or share buyback/ 
special dividends subject to applicable laws and requisite 
approvals, if any. Under this policy, the Company expects to 
progressively increase its annual dividend per share (excluding 
special dividend if any). Free cash flow is defined as net cash 
provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as per 
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. 
Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company paid 
an interim dividend of ₹18 per share and announced a final 
dividend of ₹20 per share and special dividend of ₹8 per share, 
subject to shareholders’ approval in the ensuing Annual General 
Meeting (AGM). Including the final and special dividend declared 
above, the Company has returned approximately `88,400 crore, 
which is 85% of the cumulative free cash flow for fiscals 
2020-2024 through dividends and buybacks, in line with the 
Capital Allocation Policy.

The Capital Allocation Policy is available on our website, at 
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/
documents/capital-allocation-policy.pdf.

Liquidity
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, 
investments and the cash flow that we generate from our 
operations. We continue to be debt-free and maintain sufficient 
cash to meet our strategic and operational requirements. We 
understand that liquidity in the Balance Sheet has to balance 
between earning adequate returns and the need to cover 
financial and business requirements. Liquidity enables us to be 

agile and ready for meeting unforeseen strategic and business 
needs and opportunities. 

As of March 31, 2024, we had ₹43,866 crore in working capital on 
a standalone basis, and ₹50,638 crore on a consolidated basis.

Consolidated cash and investments stand at ₹30,579 crore on a 
standalone basis and ₹39,005 crore on a consolidated basis as on 
March 31, 2024, as against ₹22,509 crore on a standalone basis, 
and ₹31,286 crore on a consolidated basis as on March 31, 2023.

Consolidated cash and investments, on both standalone and 
consolidated basis, include deposits with banks with high credit 
ratings by international and domestic credit rating agencies. 
As a result, liquidity risk of cash and cash equivalents is limited. 
Ratings are monitored periodically. Liquid assets also include 
investments in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity funds 
units, certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper (CP), 
quoted bonds and securities issued by government and quasi-
government organizations, and non-convertible debentures. 
CDs and CPs represent marketable securities of banks, NBFCs and 
eligible financial institutions for a specified time period with high 
credit rating given by domestic credit rating agencies. G-secs are 
highly liquid and marketable instruments issued across tenure, 
backed by the Government of India carrying a sovereign credit. 
Investments made in non-convertible debentures are issued by 
government-owned institutions and financial institutions with 
high credit rating. We invest after considering counterparty 
risks based on multiple criteria including Tier-I capital, capital 
adequacy ratio, credit rating, profitability, NPA levels and deposit 
base of banks and financial institutions.

The details of these investments are disclosed under 
the ‘non-current and current investments’ section in the 
Standalone and Consolidated financial statements in this 
Integrated Annual Report.

to the best of their abilities. In keeping with this goal, we have an 
open-door policy. Employees can access different forums to raise 
workplace concerns. These include a well-established and robust 
grievance resolution mechanism comprising resolution hubs; 
Hearing Employees and Resolving (HEAR) for workplace-related 
issues and Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative (ASHI) for sexual 
harassment complaints. 

Resolution hubs adhere to the principles of natural justice, 
ensure confidentiality, and non-retaliation while addressing 
concerns. The concerns are handled with utmost sensitivity 
and are redressed in a timebound manner. A detailed 
investigation is conducted to ensure fairness and provide 
an opportunity to present facts and any material evidence 
pertaining to the grievance. 

Our ASHI initiative has set an industry benchmark, being 
ranked first among 350+ companies that participated in 
an external survey on the best anti-sexual harassment 
initiatives in 2017, 2019-2023.

Infosys has constituted an Internal Committee (IC) in all the 
development centres of the Company in India to consider and 
resolve all sexual harassment complaints reported by women. 
The IC has been constituted as per the Sexual Harassment of 
Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) 
Act, 2013, and the committee includes external members from 
non-governmental organizations or with relevant experience. 
Investigations are conducted and decisions made by the IC at 
the respective locations, and a senior woman employee is the 
presiding officer over every case. Half of the total members of 
the IC are women. The role of the IC is not restricted to mere 
redressal of complaints but also encompasses prevention and 
prohibition of sexual harassment. In the last few years, the IC 
has worked extensively on creating awareness on relevance of 
sexual harassment issues in the new normal by using new and

The Company has been implementing various CSR projects for holistic community development and institution building to serve the 
enrichment and evolution of businesses and communities. For fiscal 2024, the Company has engaged an external agency to provide

and findings were collated in the form of a consolidated report for the Management’s consideration. This study was guided by 
the Inclusiveness, Relevance, Effectiveness, Convergence and Sustainability (IRECS) Framework which was used to provide overall 
feedback on the efficacy of implementation as well, as its efficiency in terms of achievement of the desired project outputs with 
reference to inputs.

row since fiscal 2020, across all emissions, as per PAS 2060:2014 
standards. As we continue to remain carbon neutral for fiscal 
2024, our efforts align with global commitments, thereby 
supporting the global response to the threat of climate change. 

Resource conservation initiativesResource conservation initiatives
Conservation of natural resources (energy and water) is important 
to maintain ecological balance and make them available 
for future generations and help protect the environment. 
Resource conservation initiatives at Infosys have been focused, 
continuous and imbibed in our operations and new infrastructure 
development. The introduction of highly efficient new buildings, 
major improvements in existing buildings, intelligent automation, 
water management plans, and waste treatment and management 
projects have significantly reduced our environmental impact. 
We have been able to expand our business while continuously 
reducing our resource intensity.

The increased adoption of renewable energy in our operations 
has helped avoid emissions significantly, and our high-
impact carbon offset projects have enabled us offset 
unavoidable emissions.

Energy: Infosys follows a two-pronged strategy of constructing 
super-efficient new buildings and improving operations in 
existing buildings. Every new building at Infosys strives to set a 
benchmark for energy efficiency, thereby redefining industry 
best standards and practices. Smart automation continues to 
play an important role in remote operations to ensure long-
term efficiency, continuously identifying opportunities for 
improvement and increasing system resilience. 

While new buildings were built to high energy efficiency 
standards from the outset, the capital investment in energy 
conservation projects in existing buildings amounted to 
`3.4 crore in fiscal 2024.

Infosys Crescent campus in Bengaluru was recognized as one 
of the 100 iconic sustainable buildings across G-20 member 
countries and beyond. Various government organizations and 
corporates visited our campuses to witness innovative energy 
and water conservation techniques. Solar Decathlon India, the 
world’s largest net-zero building challenge, held at our campus in 
Mysuru, is a testament to our advocacy efforts to positive global 
climate action beyond our boundaries.

Renewable energy: With a total installed capacity of about 
60.2 MW of solar PV, including roof-top and ground-mounted 
systems, we continue to pursue our ambition to transition to 
renewables for our operations. In addition to our own solar 
plants, we procure green power from third-party power 
producers and from DISCOMs through green tariff mechanism. 
In fiscal 2024, 67.52% of our electricity in India operations was 
met through renewables.

Green buildings: In fiscal 2024, eight of our projects in Bengaluru, 
Mangaluru, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and Nagpur were 
certified for high performance green buildings. These included 
Platinum certification from the US Green Building Council and 
Indian Green Building Council for new buildings, leased offices 
and interior retrofitted buildings that were re-certified. We now 
have around 29.6 million sq.ft of buildings with the highest level 
of green building certification.

Transformed workplace: Infosys workplace transformation 
strategy is inspired by new principles that are aligned to the 
hybrid operating model. The office spaces at all locations are 
being upgraded as per the new strategy. The new workplaces 
are designed to be productive within the hybrid operating 
model, promote the social capital of the organization, are 
flexible, equipped with technology for digital collaboration, 
provide health and wellness and are also environmentally 
sustainable in line with our ESG goals and vision. The workplace 
transformation strategy has been implemented across multiple 
locations at Infosys.

Water management: Water conservation has been one of 
our focus areas and this has been enabled through a holistic 
approach to water management. The state-of-the-art sewage 
treatment plants with tertiary treatment capabilities enable 
zero discharge of wastewater from our campuses. We have 
implemented lake rejuvenation projects near our campuses, 
that will enhance water availability in the surroundings. We have 
ensured rooftop rainwater harvesting to use rainwater effectively 
in addition to recharge of groundwater aquifers through 
injection wells in many of our campuses. 

Waste management: Infosys follows the principles of Circular 
economy, based on Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and 
Repurpose approach. We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero 
waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with 
technological investments in recycling and streamlining systems 
and processes. We have achieved TRUE certification for zero 
waste, aimed at diversion of all non-hazardous solid waste from 
landfill at three of our campuses in India during the year. We 
have focused on diverting a portion of identified waste going for 
incineration to co-processing. 

Carbon offset: Unavoidable emissions are addressed through the 
carbon offset program. Infosys continues to identify projects that 
have a high social impact – improving the health and livelihoods 
of rural families and creating employment opportunities, and 
along the way, also generating carbon offsets for the Company. 
Our unique offset program is certified to the highest level (Gold 
Standard) in terms of quality, authenticity and transparency. 

This year, we have implemented an improved cookstove project 
in Rajasthan and a biogas projects in Maharashtra and Karnataka. 
The improved cookstove reduces smoke and firewood usage, 
and thus has a positive impact on health. The families benefit 
from the biogas project as they save on fuel costs and get natural 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-2492

fertilizer as a by-product for agriculture. Our carbon offset 
program has benefited 2,64,000+ rural families and created 
over 3,900 rural jobs.

Carbon neutral events: Our vision is to ensure highest 
sustainability practices at all our global events to raise awareness 
and encourage participation in climate action. Measures taken 
to promote environmental protection include the use of eco-
friendly materials, ban on single-use plastic, and conservation of 
energy and water. The carbon emissions caused by the event are 
determined and balanced through our carbon offset program. 
In fiscal 2024, eight events organized by Infosys were 
declared carbon neutral.

“Pioneering Net Zero Buildings – The Infosys Journey”: 
In September 2023, Infosys published the book “Pioneering 
Net Zero Buildings – The Infosys Journey,” which chronicles 
our efforts in constructing super-efficient buildings and 
thus minimizing environmental impact. The book provides a 
detailed account of energy conservation at Infosys, being one 
of the main pillars in achieving carbon neutrality. The unique 
methodology, disruptive technologies and new benchmarks in 
buildings captured in the book, is intended to guide and inspire 
companies, policymakers, academia, and other stakeholders 
in the industry. The book is made available to the public and 
can be accessed at, https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-
responsibility/documents/pioneering-net-zero-buildings.pdf.

Health, safety and environment
The Health, Safety and Environmental Management System 
(HSEMS) at Infosys is an enunciation of our commitment 
to protecting the environment and providing a safe and 
healthy workplace for employees, contract workmen and 
visitors. Infosys is certified to ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental 
Management System) and ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational 
Health & Safety Management System) in line with our strategy. 
The HSEMS takes cognizance of interested parties and focuses 
on compliance with applicable laws in the regions where we 
operate. It includes well-defined policies and procedures and 
also strives to keep interested parties well-informed, trained and 
committed to our HSE process.

Technology absorption
Live Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels and 
responds in real-time – this was the theme of our transformation 
journey in the recent years. It had to be a mobile-first approach 
so that employees are connected to the organization wherever 
they are in the world and can access the organization’s resources 
to learn and contribute. The response has been phenomenal as 
over 5,50,000 users have tried the InfyMe mobile app with its 
300+ features since its launch and more than 73,000 users have 
rated it 4.6/5 on Google PlayStore. With process bursting, we 
have seen many of our key processes become faster and more 
responsive and the Live Enterprise platform itself has been built 
on the latest open source stack. Following the overwhelming 
success in Infosys, we are also seeing interest of the Orbit 
platform (InfyMe version for our clients) as 13 clients have already 
been onboarded and many more are in discussion. 

To enable this, our core backend infrastructure was transformed 
to host modern applications, using the scalability of the 

cloud, security of on-premise infrastructure in a hybrid cloud 
deployment with open source technologies and highly 
scalable container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes 
for microservices. The telemetry infrastructure using the 
ELK stack provides enhanced real-time visibility and enables 
proactive error detection and correction. In the coming days, 
we will further develop the platform and make it AI-first in 
addition to mobile-first.

Modern, hybrid, and secure workplace: Our hybrid workplace 
ecosystem brings together technologies such as borderless 
ODCs, virtual collaboration tools, and self-service applications 
to provide our employees the flexibility to work effectively 
in a hybrid environment. Our robust IT management system 
minimizes threats and prevents attacks, through a continuous 
cycle of vulnerability assessments and remediations to protect 
our data. Multiple collaboration tools enable our employees to 
connect, collaborate and innovate anytime, anywhere, resulting 
in a culture of collaboration and innovation.

Cloud-native application platform: As part of the modernization 
of applications, some applications need to be exposed to 
different user groups with different authentication mechanisms. 
The cloud-native application platform offers these possibilities 
in a ready-to-use architecture. This enables quick onboarding of 
applications with industry-standard security as well as greater 
scalability and availability using the power of the cloud.

Energy-efficient IT infrastructure 
We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to make our 
computer workload energy-efficient and environment-friendly. 
Some of the measures implemented are:

Public cloud adoption: Majority of internal IT applications 
have been moved to public cloud infrastructure. Each of 
our employees has access to the cloud-based platform for 
collaboration such as messaging, presence, video and other 
requirements. Additionally, they also have cloud-based unified 
internet access and secure private access.

Data center modernization: A strategic initiative launched by 
InfosysIT to modernize and future-proof the data center’s IT 
landscape continues to yield high rewards. Density-optimized 
hyperscale platforms have been deployed to enable high-density 
server virtualization and consolidation across the enterprise. 
Hyperscale platforms are open source-driven infrastructure 
innovations that enable agility at cloud scale as well as efficient 
pooling and utilization of resources. This initiative is delivering 
significant energy savings and reduces the total cost of 
ownership for the organization.

InfosysIT has invested in Data Center Infrastructure Management 
(DCIM) tool to gain an accurate overview of the entire IT and 
facility stack of the data center, which is the foundation for 
optimization initiatives.

Enterprise storage: We provide around 1.8PB of storage capacity 
for employees, delivery units and internal requirements on 
all flash storage with fabric pool and storage grid technology. 
Data is marked hot and cold based on policy. Cold data is 
automatically moved to cheaper storage with larger capacity, 
resulting in data tiering and savings in terms of data center space, 
power consumption and cooling.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-2496

Overview

Infosys is a leading provider of consulting, technology, 
outsourcing and next-generation digital services, enabling 
clients to create and execute strategies for their digital 
transformation and AI journey.

Our purpose is to amplify human potential and create the next 
opportunity for people, business and communities. We are 
guided by our value system which motivates our attitudes and 
actions. Our core values are Client value, Leadership by example, 
Integrity and transparency, Fairness, and Excellence (C-LIFE).

Our strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization 
that remains relevant to the agenda of our clients, while 
creating growth opportunities for our employees, generating 
profitable growth for our investors and contributing to the 
communities that we operate in. There are numerous risks and 
challenges affecting our business. These are discussed in the Risk 
management report section of the Integrated Annual Report.

I. Industry structure and developments

Fiscal 2024 saw the impact of policy tightening and a reduction 
in inflation in most of the markets we operate in. Global GDP 
is estimated to have grown at 3.2% in CY 2023, compared to 
3.5% in CY 2022(1). Worldwide IT spending on software and IT 
services was ~US$2.3 trillion(2) in CY2023 while IT services saw 
an estimated total spending of US$1.4 trillion. We expect the 
client spending and investments to move towards Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and generative AI (gen AI) in the near term. 
These investments are expected to be crucial during this period 
of economic uncertainty.

There is a new wave of dynamism in technologies. The industry 
is feeling the pressure to build AI strategies and stay ahead. 
We saw generative AI starting to reshape the industry in fiscal 
2024. We continued to witness businesses attempting to 
reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and 
agility, personalize experiences for customers and employees, 
and launch new and disruptive products and services, aided 
by generative AI. With our leadership position in AI, we 
believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of these 
market opportunities.

For more information, refer to Our business context section of the 
Integrated Annual Report.

II. Opportunities and threats

Our strategy
Our clients and prospective clients are faced with transformative 
business opportunities due to advances in software and 
computing technology. These organizations are dealing with 
the challenge of having to reinvent their processes and systems 
rapidly in the AI era. This needs an understanding of new 
technologies and new ways of working, and also appreciation of 
AI landscapes, business processes and practices. Our strategy is 
to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute 
on their journey to an AI future.

Our strengths
We believe that we are well-positioned for the principal 
competitive factors in our business. With more than four decades 
of experience in managing the systems and workings of global 
enterprises, we believe we are uniquely positioned to help 
them steer through their AI transformation as we have built our 
own AI-first strategy.

Our competition
We see intense competition in traditional services, a rapidly 
changing marketplace and the emergence of new players in 
niche technology areas.

We have invested in building proprietary intellectual property in 
software platforms and products. We have continued to invest 
in Infosys Cobalt™ – a set of services, solutions and platforms 
for enterprises to accelerate their cloud journey and Infosys 
Topaz – a set of AI-first services, solutions and platforms using 
generative AI technology.

issued across tenure, backed by the Government of India and 
carrying a sovereign credit. Investments made in non-convertible 
debentures represent debt instruments issued by government-
aided institutions and financial institutions with high credit 
rating. The majority of investments of the Company are fair 
valued based on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. The Company invests 
after considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria, 
including Tier I capital, capital adequacy ratio, credit rating, 
profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as part of our 
risk management program.

B. Trade receivables
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) was 71 days for the year ended 
March 31, 2024, compared to 62 days in the previous year. 

C. Cash and cash equivalents
Our cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks 
with high credit ratings assigned by international and domestic 
credit rating agencies which can be withdrawn at any point of 
time without prior notice or penalty on principal. Ratings are 
monitored periodically.

D. Loans
We provide loans to subsidiaries as per business requirement. 

E. Other financial assets
Restricted deposits represent amounts deposited with 
financial institutions to settle employee-related obligations 
as and when they arise during the normal course of business. 
Unbilled revenues are classified as financial assets as right to 
consideration is unconditional and is due only after passage 
of time. Foreign currency forward and options contracts are 
entered into to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on 
foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts 
is generally a bank. 

6. Other assets
Unbilled revenues are classified as non-financial asset where 
the right to consideration is dependent on completion of 
contractual milestones. Withholding taxes and others represent 
credits that can be availed against local taxes payable in 
various countries. Deferred contract cost mainly comprises 
the cost of obtaining a contract and the cost of fulfilling a 
contract recorded in accordance with Ind AS 115, Revenue from 
Contracts with Customers. 

7. Deferred tax assets / liabilities
Net deferred tax liability comprises of deferred tax liabilities 
less deferred tax assets. Deferred tax liability is primarily on 
account of temporary difference in the Special Economic Zone 
Re-investment Reserve, intangibles from business combination, 
interest receivable on income tax refund for orders received 
partially offset by deferred tax asset on property, plant and 
equipment, post-sales client support, allowances for trade 
receivables and compensated absences.

8. Income tax assets / liabilities
Our net profit earned from providing software development 
and other services outside India is subject to tax in the country 
where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries 
other than India can be claimed as credit against our tax 
liabilities in India.

9. Financial liabilities
Liabilities for accrued compensation to employees include 
the provision for bonus, accrued salaries, incentives and 
retention bonus payable to the staff. Financial liability under 
option arrangements represents redemption liability towards 
acquisitions to purchase the corresponding minority stake. 
Accrued expenses represent amounts accrued for other 
operational expenses. Compensated absences are both 
accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The expected 
cost of accumulating compensated absences is determined by 
actuarial valuation. Other financial liability includes financing 
arrangements entered into by the Company with a third party 
towards deferred contract cost assets.

10. Other liabilities
Withholding and other taxes payable represent local taxes 
payable in various countries in which we operate. Invoicing 
in excess of revenues are classified as unearned revenues. We 
provide for provident fund to eligible employees of Infosys, 
which is a defined benefit plan as the Company has an obligation 
to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from 
the investments of the trust and the notified interest rate. The 
Company operates the defined benefit pension plan in certain 
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with local laws. These plans 
are managed by third-party fund managers. We provide for 
gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan (“the Gratuity Plan”), 
covering eligible employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides 
a lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, 
incapacitation, or termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee’s salary and the tenure of 
employment. The plans provide for periodic payouts after 
retirement and / or a lump-sum payment as set out in rules of

IV. Results of our operations

For details about results of our operations, refer to 'Results of our operations and state of affairs' section in the Boards' report.

During fiscal 2024, the Company initiated Project Maximus, a comprehensive margin expansion program structured across 5 pillars – 
Value-based selling; Efficient pyramid; Lean, automation & gen AI; Improving critical portfolios and Reducing indirect costs.

1. Revenue
The growth in our revenues in fiscal 2024 from fiscal 2023 is as follows: 

(In ₹ crore)

Particulars Standalone Consolidated

2024 2023 % change 2024 2023 % change

Revenue 1,28,933 1,24,014 4.0 1,53,670 1,46,767 4.7 

The increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase 
in revenue from software services, large deal wins, and increase 
in realization including pricing.

Revenue growth in reported terms includes the impact of 
currency fluctuations. We, therefore, additionally report the 
revenue growth in constant currency terms, which represents 
the real growth in revenue, excluding the impact of currency 
fluctuations. We calculate constant currency growth by 
comparing current-period revenues in respective local currencies 
converted to INR using prior-period exchange rates and 
comparing the same to our prior-period reported revenues. Our 
revenues in reported currency terms for fiscal 2024 is US$ 18,562 
million, a growth of 1.9%. Our revenues for fiscal 2024 in constant 
currency grew by 1.4%.

We added 385 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2024 as 
compared to 458 new customers (gross) during fiscal 2023.

On a consolidated basis, for the year ended March 31, 2024, 
approximately 97.5% were export revenues whereas 2.5% were 
domestic revenues, while for the year ended March 31, 2023, 
97.4% were export revenues whereas 2.6% were domestic 
revenues. Refer to the ‘Segmental profitability’ section in this 
report for more details on the analysis of segment revenues.

2. Expenditure
Cost of sales 
The cost of efforts, comprising employee cost and cost of 
technical sub-contractors, has decreased as a percentage of 
revenue from 61.6% in fiscal 2023 to 60.2% in fiscal 2024 on a 
standalone basis, and from 58.0% in fiscal 2023 to 56.4% in fiscal 
2024 on a consolidated basis. The cost of efforts has decreased 
mainly on account of decrease in sub-contractors cost and on 
account of improved utilization.

Third-party items bought for service delivery to clients include 
software and hardware, which are integral to our overall service 
delivery to clients.

Selling and marketing expenses
The selling and marketing expenses on standalone basis and 
consolidated basis have increased as a percentage of revenue 
during fiscal 2024 to 4.4% from 4.0% in fiscal 2023, and 4.5% 
during fiscal 2024 from 4.3% in fiscal 2023, respectively, mainly 
on account of increase in employee benefit costs and branding 
and marketing expenses.

General and administration expenses
The general and administration expenses on standalone basis 
have reduced as a percentage of revenue during fiscal 2024 to 
4.2% from 4.3% in fiscal 2023, mainly on account of a decrease in 
consulting and professional expenses and remained unchanged 
on consolidated basis during fiscal 2024 at 4.9%.

3. Other income and finance cost
Other income primarily includes income from investments, gain 
/ loss on investments, foreign exchange gain / loss on forward 
and options contracts, foreign exchange gain / loss on translation 
of other assets and liabilities and interest on income tax refund. 
Other income for fiscal 2024 includes interest (pre-tax) on 
income tax refund of ₹1,933 crore on account of orders received 
under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, from 
the income tax authorities in India for certain assessment years. 
In fiscal 2024, the Company received ₹2,976 crore of dividend 
from our subsidiaries, which is reflected in the Standalone 
financial statement.

Interest income in fiscal 2024 has increased as compared to fiscal 
2023 primarily due to a increase in yield on investments. We use 
foreign exchange forward and options contracts to hedge our 
exposure against movements in foreign exchange rates. Finance 
cost is on account of leases. The lease payments are discounted 
using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily 
determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 99

4. Provision for tax
We have provided for our tax liability both in India and overseas. 
The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for both the 
years ended March 31, 2024, and March 31, 2023 is 34.94%. 

Particulars Standalone Consolidated

2024 2023 2024 2023

Income tax expense (In ₹ crore) 8,719 8,375 9,740 9,214

Effective tax rate (In %) 24.3 26.5 27.1 27.7

Effective tax rate is generally influenced by various factors, 
including differential tax rates, non-deductible expenses, 
exempt non-operating income, overseas taxes, benefits from 
SEZ units, tax reversals and provisions pertaining to prior periods 
primarily on account of adjudication of certain disputed matters, 
filing of tax return and completion of assessments, across 
various jurisdictions. 

Provision for tax includes net tax reversal of ₹38 crore on 
account of orders received under Sections 250 and 254 of 
the Income-tax Act, 1961, from the income tax authorities in 

India for certain assessment years. These orders confirmed the 
Company's position with respect to tax treatment of certain 
contentious matters and upon resolution of the disputes , an 
amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been reduced from 
contingent liabilities.

5. Segmental profitability
The Company’s operations predominantly relate to providing 
end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance 
performance of their business. Business segments of the 
Company are primarily enterprises in Financial Services 
and Insurance; enterprises in Manufacturing; enterprises in 
Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics; enterprises

Overall segment profitability has decreased primarily on account 
of the increase in employee compensation, higher cost of third-
party items bought for service delivery to clients as part of deals, 
a one-off impact arising from contract renegotiation / rescoping 
and cyber impact largely offset by benefit from Project Maximus 
through improved utilization, decrease in cost of technical sub-
contractors etc., and currency benefits.

6. Liquidity
Our principal source of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
and cash flow that we generate from operations. We have no 
outstanding borrowings. We believe our working capital is 
sufficient for our requirements. 

Our growth has been financed largely through cash 
generated from operations.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24100

Management’s discussion and analysis

Our cash flows are robust. Our operating cash flows have 
increased in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 mainly on 
account of increase in net profit adjusted for non-cash items 
partially offset by higher income tax payments.

Consolidated cash and investments of ₹39,005 crore 
comprise cash and cash equivalents, current and non-
current investments excluding investments in equity and 
preference shares and others.

Capital Allocation Policy 
Refer to the Board’s report in this Integrated Annual Report

V. Outlook, risks and concerns

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is 
implemented across the organization by the risk management 
office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the 
best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to 
suit our unique business requirements.

We have provided the details of Infosys ERM framework, key and 
emerging risks along with mitigation in the risk management 
report section of this integrated annual report. The list of risk 
factors which we track for our business are covered in our 20-F 
filing available at https://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-
filings/annual-report/annual-reports.html. 

VI. Internal Financial Control Systems and their 
adequacy

Infosys has aligned its current systems of internal financial 
control with the requirement of Companies Act, 2013, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to 
increase transparency and accountability in an organization’s 
process of designing and implementing a system of internal 
control. The framework requires a company to identify and 
analyze risks and manage appropriate responses.

Internal financial control systems include the design, 
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial 
controls that are operating effectively for ensuring the orderly 
and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to 
company’s policies, safeguarding of its assets, prevention and 
detection of frauds and errors, accuracy and completeness of 
the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable 
financial information, as required under the Act.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 101

In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and 
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and 
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, 
can only provide reasonable assurance that the objectives 
of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Based on 
their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this 
Integrated Annual Report , our CEO and CFO have concluded 
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to 
provide reasonable assurance that the information required 
to be disclosed in filings and submissions, is recorded, 
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods 
specified, and that material information related to us and our 
consolidated subsidiaries is accumulated and communicated to 
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions about 
required disclosure.

VII. Material developments in human resources / 
industrial relations, including number of people 
employed

Our culture and reputation as a leader in consulting, technology, 
outsourcing and next-generation digital services enable us to 
attract and retain some of the best talent.

Human resources management
Infosys is a people company that understands the immense 
potential of technology and strives to create a world-class 
employee experience. The company has implemented various 
initiatives to inspire and enable its employees to find purpose 
and make an indelible impact through meaningful work and 
passionate teams, ensure that they continuously learn and 
grow in their careers and shape the collective future, and create 
opportunities for every employee to navigate further, powered 
by the culture and values of Infosys.

This is true at each stage of career for our employees. A strong 
focus on leadership development has ensured that we have a 
robust leadership bench at all times, encouraging leaders from 
within the Company to move up and take on new challenges. 
While fiscal 2024 saw some leadership exits, it also saw the 
emergence of a number of internal leaders not only ensuring 
business continuity, but also helping us close the year with the 
highest-ever large deal signings of US$17.7 billion.

Adapting to the changing work environment, Infosys has 
adopted a hybrid model of work that balances employee 
flexibility and business requirement. Leveraging technology and 
automation, it has improved workforce efficiency, engagement, 
transformation, and innovation. Recognizing and rewarding its 
employees for their performance, excellence, and leadership, 
it has fostered a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion, 
and ensured a safe and positive work environment for all 
its employees. Infosys has also received several awards and 
accolades for its best-in-class HR practices and processes.

For more details on the material developments in human 
resources / industrial relations, please refer to the link 
https://www.infosys.com/sustainability/documents/infosys-
esg-report-2023-24.pdf 

Resolution hubs
Infosys is committed to providing a safe and positive work 
environment. In keeping with this philosophy, the organization 
envisages an open-door policy and encourages a culture of 
“speak up”. Employees also have access to several forums 
where they can highlight matters or concerns faced at the 
workplace for effective remediation. This is achieved through 
a well-established and robust grievance resolution mechanism 
comprising resolution hubs. Resolution hubs adhere to the 
principles of natural justice, confidentiality, sensitivity, non-
retaliation and fairness, while addressing concerns. The concerns 
are handled objectively while ensuring timely action and closure. 
In matters that entail a detailed investigation, the process 
ensures fairness for all involved, with an opportunity to be heard, 
present facts and any material evidence before a neutral panel.

HEAR
Infosys has a robust grievance redressal forum called HEAR 
(Hearing Employees And Resolving) fostering healthy employee 
relations and a positive work environment by giving our 
employees a neutral platform ‘to be heard’ and building the 
culture of ‘speak up’. Employees can raise a complaint on the 
HEAR webapp or InfyMe mobile application or write to HEAR@
infosys.com. HEAR adopts a decentralized model and addresses 
employee concerns in a structured manner with appellate forums 
for workplace grievances that have not been duly heard at the 
preliminary level by the Managers (or) line HR.

ASHI
The Company’s assurance to its employees of providing a 
harassment-free workplace is reflected in our key initiative, ASHI 
(Anti-Sexual Harassment Initiative). As per the Prevention of 
Sexual Harassment Act in India, the Company has constituted 
Internal Committees (IC) in all the development centers with 
the ambit of the regulatory jurisdiction, for redressal of sexual 
harassment matters reported by women employees. We also 
have a strong governance mechanism in the form of GRB 
(Grievance Redressal Body) to define, interpret and implement 
Company’s policy on anti-harassment and anti-discrimination 
at workplace. GRB consists of external members, internal senior 
members, and the Investigative Council. Here, we follow a 
gender-neutral approach in redressal of all such complaints. 
Complaints are taken up for a formal redressal process in line

with the POSH Act and the Company’s policy on anti-harassment 
as applicable. The reports on ASHI grievances can be shared to 
GRB@infosys.com and India employees can log reports on the 
ASHI webapp or InfyMe mobile application.

Extending the initiative to contract staff
Our commitment to a positive and safe working environment 
is not restricted only to our employees, but also third parties, 
who provide services in our campuses. We conduct refresher 
sessions for such third-party employees to reinforce the message. 
These sessions are covered in nine vernacular languages in India 
currently. Emergency / safety cards with important contact 
numbers are also handed over to all Infosys employees and 
employees of such third parties.

Whistleblower Policy
The Company has formulated the Whistleblower Policy in 
line with the mandated regulatory requirements – Sarbanes-
Oxley Act (SOX), 2002 & Companies Act, 2013 – which 
mandates listed companies to establish a “vigil mechanism” for 
reporting genuine concerns.

The forum is predominantly for the receipt, retention and 
treatment of complaints regarding matters of probable 
discrepancies in accounting, internal accounting controls or 
auditing, and also enables anonymous reporting by employees. 
While the Whistleblower Policy and the forum is administered 
and managed by the Office of Integrity and Compliance, 
complaints (anonymous or otherwise) pertaining to deviations in 
workplace policies / processes involving employees are reviewed 
in tandem by the Employee Relations Department.

Human rights
Infosys is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC) and supports the protection and elevation of human 
rights in accordance with the UN Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, 
and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (the ILO Declaration). 
Our Human Rights Statement provides a broad framework to 
ensure that all employees are treated with respect and dignity 
and ensure that we do not condone human rights violations 
or abuses. Our Supplier Code of Conduct helps us manage 
and address this important aspect of sustainable business 
in our supply chains.

Our salient human rights issues are:

1. Workplace diversity: A key tenet of the Code of Conduct 
and Ethics is respecting each other through creating an equal 
opportunity workplace, ensuring equal pay for equal work, 
free of discrimination and harassment.

2. Harassment: The organization envisages an open-door 
policy. This is achieved through a well-established and robust 
grievance resolution mechanism comprising resolution hubs.

3. Freedom of association: We respect the rights of our 
employees to associate or not associate through internal 
employee resource groups and seek representation, to 
bargain or not bargain collectively, in accordance with 
local laws.

4. Health and safety: These are prerequisites for conducting 
business responsibly. Ozone, Infosys’ Health, Safety 
and Environmental Management System (HSEMS), has 
evolved into a robust management system guided by the 
requirements from multiple stakeholders, including clients, 
internal customers, vendor partners, law enforcement and 
regulatory bodies, and the communities in which we operate.

5. Data privacy: With the Data Privacy Office (DPO) directly 
reporting to the Board, Infosys ensures there is no conflict of 
interest in the DPO playing an effective role to ensure privacy 
of our employees, candidates, visitors, customers, and other 
stakeholders, according to applicable data privacy regulations 
across the globe, including but not limited to GDPR, CCPA, 
LGPD, both as a data controller and processor.

6. Sustainable development: In 2020, we launched our ESG 
Vision 2030 to shape and share solutions that serve the 
development of businesses and communities.

Recruitment
As of March 31, 2024, the Group employed 3,17,240 employees, of 
which 2,99,814 were professionals involved in service delivery to 
clients, including trainees.

We constantly attract and hire a multi-dimensional workforce 
across all IT specializations. We have built robust relationships 
with top institutions globally and recruit students who have 
consistently shown high levels of achievement. We have been 
globally recognized once again for our HackWithInfy initiative, 
an online coding contest, which also helps us attract the best 
coders. We have continued upscaling our InfyTQ platform, 
which brings the best of our Mysuru training to the hands of the 
learners across the country.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, we evolved from 
a virtual-only mode to a hybrid model of virtual and 
in-person recruitment.

We launched the RestartWithInfy program to bring women who 
have had to drop out of active employment in the IT industry 
back to the mainstream. Through this successful initiative, we 
have hired 517 women into the Infosys ecosystem.

During fiscal 2024, we received 24,36,929 employment 
applications, interviewed 1,94,367 applicants and extended 
offers of employment to 26,975 applicants. These statistics do 
not include our subsidiaries.

Education, training and assessment (ETA)

VIII. Other details

1. Quality
The Quality function at Infosys, in line with the organization’s 
vision and strategy of ‘Navigate the Next’, has three 
strategic imperatives:

• Differentiate Infosys’ services through superior performance 
and quality

• Optimize Infosys’ client projects as well as internal functions 
for greater efficiency and agility

• De-risk Infosys’ operations by ensuring delivery excellence, 
compliance and sustainability

Our Quality team continues to scale and evolve our capabilities 
in Agile, DevSecOps and Site Reliability Engineering, apart from 
driving the shift from project to product and platform-led ways 
of working using our product-centric value delivery approach. 
The Quality team also consults several clients in transforming 
their ways of working to be faster, better, and efficient.

Today, clients are looking at maximizing their return from 
investments in digital technologies leveraging the power of AI. 
This requires multiple capabilities across product-based working, 
user experience design, data, advanced engineering, and digital 
talent enablement to come together seamlessly in the context 
of a digital transformation program. The evolved Infosys digital 
operating model for an AI-first enterprise was released last year, 
to address this need.

Quality has been leading the way in driving lean and automation 
in the organization to enhance productivity and quality, which 
has resulted in large optimization in projects. It deployed 
robust frameworks, tools and platforms across service lines 
in a collaborative manner to drive hyper-productivity and 
engineering excellence. Last year, the Quality team created a 
holistic automation maturity model to help navigate projects 
towards increasing automation levels, from point tools towards 
cognitive and autonomous operations, leveraging AI and Gen AI.

Quality continues to drive best practices and sustenance 
through structured audits and assessment frameworks, focusing 
on de-risking the organization, with augmented coverage of 
services, centers and subsidiaries. We continue to comply with 
international management system standards and models, viz., 
ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, ISO 22301, ISO 20000, 
AS 9100 and ISO 27701.This includes the Infosys group's transition 
to the new information security standard ISO 27001 : 2022.

Infosys is the first IT company to comply with and get certified 
for ISO 42001:2023 standard for AI management systems. The 
Company continued to comply with and get assessed at the 
enterprise level for SSAE 18 SOC 2 type II & ISAE 3402 / SSAE 18 
SOC 1 type II, including cloud platforms and AI and has received 
an independent auditors’ assurance compliance report. Six of 
our IT hubs based in the US were certified for the first time for 
ISO 27001 Information security, ISO 27701 Data Privacy, and ISO 
22301 Business continuity management system.

5. Infosys Leadership Institute 
Continuing its award-winning streak, the Infosys Leadership 
Institute (ILI) won the prestigious Society of Human Resources 
(SHRM) Excellence award for Developing Leaders of Tomorrow 
in fiscal 2024. This was accompanied by the highest internal 
recognition of Infosys Awards for Excellence for its IamtheFuture 
program focused on leadership diversity and Constellation 
program focused on strengthening the leadership succession 
pool. As a part of the Constellation program, the high-potential 
leaders continued to work on the organizational strategic 
projects, bolstered by a certificate program on Organizational 
Change Leadership from MIT.

In addition to strengthening the succession pool through the 
Constellation program, there were specific programs designed 
to augment succession strength across the organization. With 
technology-led disruption becoming all-pervasive, particularly 
driven by GenAI, ILI curated a business-oriented certification 

program on AI by Kellogg. More than 400 leaders have 
enrolled in the program and this focus will continue in fiscal 
2025. Leadership engagement and development continue to 
strengthen with about 95% of our leaders completing at least 
one significant leadership program this year, with more than 
70% completing a certification program from an Ivy League 
institution. Our leaders invested about 10,000 learning days 
equivalent to strengthen their leadership capabilities.

The third phase of the highly-acclaimed IamtheFuture program 
commenced in fiscal 2024, with a focus on building higher-
order organizational and leadership capabilities, culminating in 
projects designed for business impact. More than 500 women 
leaders have completed various phases of this program, earning 
the ILI-Stanford GSB certificate.

6. Infosys Knowledge Institute

Our corporate governance philosophy 

Our corporate governance is a reflection of our value system, 
encompassing our culture, policies, and relationships with our 
stakeholders. Integrity and transparency are key to our corporate 
governance practices and performance, and ensure that we gain 
and retain the trust of our stakeholders at all times.

Corporate governance is an ethically-driven business 
process that is committed to values aimed at enhancing an 
organization’s capacity to create wealth. This is ensured by 
taking ethical business decisions and conducting business with 
a firm commitment to values, while meeting stakeholders’ 
expectations. At Infosys (“the Company”), it is imperative that our 
Company affairs are managed in a fair and transparent manner. 
This is vital to gain and retain the trust of our stakeholders.

We are committed to defining, following and practicing 
the highest level of corporate governance across all our 
business functions. 

Our corporate governance is a statement of the values we 
stand by as we conduct our business and engage with our 
stakeholders. Our Company has been a leader in adopting 
internationally-recognized corporate governance guidelines and 
has set the highest standards in abiding by them.

Our governance rests on our core value system of C-LIFE (Client 
Value, Leadership by Example, Integrity and transparency, 
Fairness and Excellence) and is guided by the OECD (Organization 
for Economic Co-operation and Development) principles. Our

Board as a trustee

The Board recognizes its primary role of trusteeship of shareholder capital. 
As a trustee, it strives to ensure excellence and integrity in setting world-class 
corporate governance standards.

Corporate governance guidelines
Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of our sustained 
performance and has helped us gain the trust and respect 
of all our stakeholders. The enhancement of these corporate 
governance standards, through periodic evaluation and change, 
is one of the most important aspects of ensuring value creation 
for our stakeholders. 

Our corporate governance follows the guidelines established 
by the Board of the Company. These guidelines provide a 
structure within which directors and the Management can 
effectively pursue the Company’s objectives for the benefit 
of its stakeholders. These are framed in conjunction with the 
Company’s Memorandum & Articles of Association, the charters 
of the committees of the Board and applicable laws / regulations 
/ guidelines in force in India, the US and other jurisdictions, as 
applicable. The guidelines can be accessed on our website, at 
https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/
Documents/corporate-governance-guidelines.pdf.

Role of the Board of Directors
The primary role of the Board is that of trusteeship – to protect 
and enhance shareholder value. As trustees, the Board has a 
fiduciary responsibility to ensure that the Company has clear 
goals aligned to shareholder value and its growth. Further, the 
Board is also responsible for: 

• Exercising appropriate control to ensure that the Company 
is managed efficiently to fulfil stakeholders’ aspirations and 
societal expectations.

• Monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s governance 
practices and making changes as necessary.

• Providing strategic guidance to the Company and ensuring 
effective monitoring of the Management.

• Exercising independent judgment on corporate affairs.

• Assigning a sufficient number of non-executive members of 
the Board to tasks where there is a potential for conflict of 
interest, to exercise independent judgment.

• Reviewing and guiding corporate strategy, major plans 
of action, risk policy, annual budgets and business plans, 
setting performance objectives, monitoring implementation 
and corporate performance, and overseeing major capital 
expenditures, acquisitions and divestments.

Independent directors
We abide by the definitions of an independent director, as laid 
down under the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) and the SEBI 
(Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 
2015 (“the Listing Regulations”), as amended, along with the 
definitions laid down in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) 
listed company manual, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US 
securities laws by virtue of our listing on the NYSE in the US.

Based on the disclosures received from all independent directors 
and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfil 
the conditions specified in the Act, the Listing Regulations, NYSE 
listing manual and are independent of the Management.

Board composition
The Company recognizes and embraces the importance of a 
diverse Board in its success. We believe that a truly diverse Board 
will leverage differences in thought, perspective, regional and 
industry experience, cultural and geographical background, 
age, ethnicity, race, gender, knowledge, skills including 
expertise in financial, diversity, global business, leadership, 
information technology, mergers and acquisitions, Board service 
and governance, sales and marketing, Environmental, Social 
and Governance (ESG), risk management and cybersecurity 
and other domains, which will ensure that Infosys retains its 
competitive advantage.

As on March 31, 2024, the Board comprised of nine members, 
consisting of a non-executive and non-independent Chairman, 
Chief Executive Officer & Managing Director (CEO & MD), and 
seven independent directors.

Board meetings
Scheduling and selection of agenda items for Board 
meetings
The tentative dates of Board meetings for the next fiscal 
are decided in advance and published in the Integrated 
Annual Report. The Chairman and the Company Secretary, in 
consultation with the CEO & MD, propose the agenda for each 
meeting, along with explanatory notes, and distribute these in 
advance to the directors. Every Board member can suggest the 
inclusion of additional items in the agenda. 

The Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly 
results and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings 
are held when necessary. Independent directors are expected 
to attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, with the Board 
being represented by independent directors from various 
parts of the world, it may not be possible for all of them to be 
physically present at all meetings. Hence, we provide video / 
teleconferencing facilities to enable their participation.

The Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for, 
attend and participate in Board and applicable committee 
meetings. Each member is expected to ensure their 
other commitments do not materially interfere with their 
responsibilities towards the Company.

Meeting of independent directors
For the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters 
related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, 
it is important for the independent directors to have meetings 
without the presence of the executive management.

Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder 
mandate that the independent directors of the Company 
shall hold at least one meeting in a financial year, without the 
attendance of non-independent directors and members of 
the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came 
into effect, our Board’s process mandated periodic meetings 
attended exclusively by the independent directors. 

During the year, the independent directors met four times. At 
such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other 
matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by 
it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, 
leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, 
Board movements, succession planning, human resources 
matters and the performance of the executive members of the 
Board, and the Chairman.

is chosen as the chairperson of the committee. The Company 
also has a Cybersecurity Risk Sub-committee under the Risk 
Management Committee. The Sub-committee comprises only 
independent directors.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 109

Responsible leadership

Leading by example is a key tenet of corporate governance at Infosys. 
Both the Board and the Management work together to set the highest 
standards of responsible leadership.

Responsibilities of the Board leadership
We believe that an active, well-informed, diversified and 
independent board is necessary to ensure the highest standards 
of corporate governance. At Infosys, the Board is at the core 
of our corporate governance practice. The Board oversees the 
Management’s functions and protects the long-term interests 
of our stakeholders. 

The responsibilities and authority of the Chairman, the CEO & MD 
and the lead independent director are as follows:

Chairman
The Company has separated the roles of Chairman and the CEO 
& MD to create a more balanced governance structure. The 
Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for fostering and 
promoting the integrity of the Board while nurturing a culture in 
which the Board works harmoniously for the long-term benefit 
of the Company and all its stakeholders. He presides over all 
meetings of the Board and of the shareholders of the Company.

The Chairman takes a lead role in managing the Board and 
facilitates effective communication among directors. He is 
responsible for overseeing matters pertaining to governance, 
including the organization, composition and effectiveness 
of the Board and its committees, and the performance of 
individual directors. 

The Chairman actively works with the Nomination and 
Remuneration Committee to plan the composition of the 
Board and Board committees, induct directors to the Board, 
plan for director succession, participate effectively in the Board 
evaluation process and meet with individual directors to provide 
constructive feedback and advice.

CEO & MD
The CEO & MD is responsible for executing corporate strategy 
in consultation with the Board, as well as for brand equity, 
planning, building external contacts and all matters related 
to the management of the Company. He is responsible for 
achieving annual and long-term business targets. The CEO 
& MD also monitors the external and internal competitive 
landscape, and new industry developments and standards, 
identifies opportunities for expansion and acquisition, and 
builds relationships with customers and markets to enhance 
shareholder value and implementing the organization’s vision, 
mission, and overall direction.

The CEO & MD acts as a link between the Board and the 
Management and is also responsible for leading and evaluating 
the work of other executive leaders.

Lead Independent Director
The lead independent director was appointed by the Board 
to ensure robust independent leadership of the Board. The 
general authority and responsibilities of the lead independent 
director are decided by the group of independent directors. The 
lead independent director also performs additional duties as 
determined by the Board.

The lead independent director provides leadership to the 
independent directors, liaises on behalf of the independent 
directors and ensures the Board’s effectiveness in maintaining 
high-quality governance of the organization and effective 
functioning of the Board.

Selection and appointment of new directors 

The Board delegates the screening and selection process to the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee. It presents a diverse 
slate of recommendations of eligible candidates to the Board for 
their approval as per the criteria laid down in Nomination and 
Remuneration Policy. Subsequently, the Board recommends and 
place it before the shareholders for their approval. 

Succession planning
The Nomination and Remuneration Committee works with 
the Board on the leadership succession plan to ensure orderly 
succession in appointments to the Board and to senior 
management positions. The Company strives to maintain 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the 
organization and the Board in an endeavour to introduce new 
perspectives while maintaining experience and continuity. 
In addition, promoting senior management within the 
organization fuels the ambitions of the talent force to earn 
future leadership roles.

Training of Board members
All new non-executive directors inducted to the Board are 
introduced to our Company culture through orientation sessions. 
Executive directors and senior management provide an overview 
of operations and familiarize the new non-executive directors 
on matters related to our values and commitments. They are 
also introduced to the organization structure, services, Group 
structure and subsidiaries, constitution, Board procedures, 
matters reserved for the Board, major risks and risk management 
strategy. The details of the familiarization program are also

Non-executive and independent directors of the Board are 
familiarized through engagements such as:

Strategy retreat: We organize an annual management strategy 
retreat with the Board to deliberate on various topics related to 
strategic planning, progress of ongoing strategic initiatives, risks 
to strategy execution and the need for new strategic programs 
to achieve the Company’s long-term objectives. This provides 
the Board members a platform to bring their expertise to various 
strategic initiatives, while also giving an opportunity for them to 
understand detailed aspects of execution and challenges relating 
to the specific theme.

Through this process, members of the Board get a 
comprehensive and balanced perspective on the strategic issues 
facing the Company, the competitive differentiation being 
pursued by the Company, an overview of the execution plan and 
interact closely with the senior leadership of the Company.

During the year, the following trainings were

global macro trends; iv) Understanding neural and deep

This session covered topics such as crisis management and

This course covered topics such as global outlook on ESG risks 
and opportunities, global ESG (reporting) frameworks and

choose to attend educational programs in the areas of Board / 
corporate governance.

Fairness and excellence

Two of the core values of our C-LIFE, fairness and excellence are evident 
in the workings of the Board, its evaluation and the compensation paid to 
the directors and the executive leadership.

Board member evaluation
One of the key functions of the Board is to monitor and review 
the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee to lay down the 
evaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the 
Board, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / 
independent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the 
director being evaluated.

Independent directors have three key roles – governance, control 
and guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the 
independent directors are evaluated, include:

• The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate 
governance practices

• The ability to contribute by introducing international best 
practices to address business challenges and risks

• Active participation in long-term strategic planning

• Commitment to the fulfilment of a director’s obligations and 
fiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board 
and committee meetings.

To improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, 
as well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous 
Board review is internally undertaken on an annual basis. 

The Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory 
firm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal 
2024. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer 
aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the 
Board or its committees, among other matters. The methodology 
included various techniques such as questionnaires, one-on-
one discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed 
with the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress 
on recommendations from last year and the current year’s 
recommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession 
planning and committee composition were also considered. The 
Board evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2024.

Further, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation 
received from the independent directors that they met the 
independence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, 
the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.

Board and executive leadership compensation
Executive leadership compensation
Our executive compensation programs encourage reward 
for performance. A significant portion of the executives’ 
total rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate 
performance goals to align with the interests of the shareholders.

As required under the Listing Regulations, the Nomination 
and Remuneration Committee recommends to the Board the 
payment of remuneration to the senior management. The 
Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the Company is available 
on our website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-
governance/documents/nomination-remuneration-policy.pdf. 

Non-executive and non-independent chairman’s 
compensation 
Nandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive 
any remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.

Independent directors’ compensation
The compensation payable to the independent directors is 
limited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved 
by the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit 
for the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies 
Act, 2013. The Board reviews the performance of independent 
directors on an annual basis.

The Board, while deciding the basis for determining the 
compensation of the independent directors, takes various things 
into consideration. These include global board compensation 
benchmarking, participation of individual directors in Board and 
committee meetings, other responsibilities, such as membership 
or chairmanship of committees, time spent in carrying out 
other duties, roles and functions as prescribed in Schedule 
IV of the Act, Listing Regulations and such other factors as 
the Board deems fit.

Shareholders at the 34th AGM held on June 22, 2015 approved 
a sum not exceeding 1% of the net profit of the Company per 
annum, calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 
198 of the Companies Act, 2013, to be paid and distributed 
among some or all of the non-executive directors of the 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24130

Company in a manner decided by the Board. This payment will 
be made with respect to the profits of the Company for each year.

The amount payable to independent directors for the year 
ended March 31, 2024 is `15.67 crore. Additionally, independent

non-executive / independent directors.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 133

Integrity and transparency & Relationship with stakeholders

Our Company upholds integrity and transparency in all transactions and 
communications to stakeholders. Our stakeholders are our partners in the path 
to sustained value creation and therefore, our relationship with stakeholders and 
clear communication with them is at the center of all disclosures and reports. 

Corporate
Infosys was incorporated in Pune, in 1981, as Infosys Consultants 
Private Limited, a private limited company under the Companies 
Act, 1956. In 1983, the corporate headquarters were relocated 
to Bengaluru. The name of the Company was changed to 
Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys 
Technologies Limited in June 1992, when the Company became a 
public limited company. We made an Initial Public Offering (IPO) 
in February 1993 and were listed on stock exchanges in India in 
June 1993. Trading opened at ₹145 per share, compared to the 
IPO price of ₹95 per share. In October 1994, we made a private 
placement of 5,50,000 shares at ₹450 each to Foreign Institutional 
Investors (FIIs), Financial Institutions (FIs) and body corporates.

On March 11, 1999, Infosys listed on NASDAQ, becoming the 
first Indian company to do so. We issued 20,70,000 American 
Depositary Shares (ADSs) (equivalent to 10,35,000 equity shares 
of par value ₹10 each) at US$34 per ADS under the ADS Program, 
and these ADSs were listed on the NASDAQ National Market.

The share data mentioned before is unadjusted for stock split 
and bonus shares. In July 2003, June 2005 and November 
2006, we issued secondary-sponsored American Depositary 
Receipts (ADRs) of US$294 million, US$1.1 billion and US$1.6 
billion, respectively. On March 11, 2024, Infosys marked 25 years 
of listing in the US.

During fiscal 2012, the name of the Company was changed 
from Infosys Technologies Limited to Infosys Limited to mark 
the transition from being a technology services provider to a 
business transformation partner to our clients.

During fiscal 2013, we delisted our ADSs from NASDAQ, and listed 
them in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Euronext London 
and Euronext Paris. During fiscal 2019, the Company voluntarily 
delisted from Euronext London and Paris due to low trading 
volume. Infosys equity shares and ADSs are listed on NSE and 
BSE in India and in NYSE, respectively, under the symbol “INFY”. 
Indian IT services sector is credited as having put India on the 
global map over two decades ago, with Infosys widely seen as 
being the ‘posterchild’ of the sector.

Note:
The above graph depicts the increase in the number of Infosys shares as a result of the Company’s bonus issues over the years and a stock split in 2000 in the ratio 
of 2:1. For example, if the investor / shareholder held one share in 1986 prior to the bonus issue and continued to hold it, he would have 16,384 shares today owing 
to the bonus share issues and stock split.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 147

“ Risks related to the geo-political changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, talent 
availability, technology disruption and cybersecurity have impacted businesses across the world during the 
fiscal year. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on 
our most important priorities toward all our stakeholders.”

Deepak Bhalla
EVP – Chief Risk Officer

Note: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward-looking in 
nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. 
If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, 
financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are 
material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own 
judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables 
the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives by 
identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and 
governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While 
this is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to 
stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, regulatory 
bodies, partners and the community around us – are the 
foundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive 
identification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our 
organization to boost performance with effective and timely 
decision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful 
consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential 
risks and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective 
resource allocation through structured qualitative and 
quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based 
on our risk appetite. Our ERM framework also enables the 
identification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, 

which are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. 
Our ERM framework encompasses all of the Company’s risks 
– strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and 
compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or 
external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used 
to identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks 
faced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while 
framing our risk responses.

Emerging risks: Our ERM framework has defined a process to 
identify, assess, plan, and monitor risks emerging from internal 
and external environments, which enable the Company to build 
and maintain resilience in uncertain times. The process includes 
horizon scanning, and SWOT analysis, which cover political, 
economic, social, technology, legal and environmental aspects. 
The emerging risks are monitored constantly and discussed 
in the risk councils and with the Risk Management Committee 
(RMC) of the Board on periodic basis.

Strategy and strategy execution The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the 
successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our 
industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target 
markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.

Operational The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery 
or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. For 
example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, business activity disruptions 
due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity 
attacks.

Legal and compliance The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing 
resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, 
codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.

Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework

We have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our 
ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique 
business requirements.

Salient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program

Our ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness 
across the organization.

Secondary, consequential and residual risks
Secondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation 

of primary risks. Consequential risks are the unintended 
consequences of primary mitigation, and residual risks are 

those risks that are left over after mitigation.

Process risk frameworks

Aggregation and accumulation

Exposure for same risks are aggregated as it goes up the 
hierarchy. This provides enterprise-wide view

to the leadership. Cumulated risk view is also provided to 
understand total exposure arising out of all risks at a unit level.

Process-speci�c risk frameworks have been 
developed for decision-making,

for example, frameworks for customer risk, 
vendor risk, contractual liability, contractual 

weighted risk and credit risk.

Intelligent risk analytics
Internal and external risk and performance indicators, 
and loss incidents are used in real time to identify, 
analyze and assess potential issues that could negatively 
impact strategic goals.

RISC360 : iGRC

Risk culture

RISC360 is the Company’s Governance, Risk management and 
Compliance (GRC) program that combines three lines of defense 
under one umbrella. This enables risk-based decision-making and 
auditing. The Company has implemented a technology platform, 
iGRC, to provide a consolidated view of risks to strategic goals.

Our risk culture encourages open and upward communication. 
Coupled with our belief systems and core values, this drives 
behavior, guides daily activities and decision-making throughout 
the organization. We encourage sharing of knowledge and best 
practices, continuous process improvement and a strong 
commitment to ethics and integrity.

McCamish cybersecurity incident
Infosys McCamish Systems (“McCamish”) engaged cybersecurity 
and other specialists to assist in its investigation of and response 
to its November 2023 cybersecurity incident and remediation 
and restoration of impacted applications and systems. By 
December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external specialists’ 
assistance, substantially remediated and restored the affected 
applications and systems. Actions taken by McCamish also 
included investigative analysis conducted by a third-party 

cybersecurity firm to determine, among other things, whether 
and the extent to which data was subject to unauthorized access 
or exfiltration and engaging a third-party eDiscovery vendor in 
assessing the extent and nature of such data.

McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery 
vendor has identified up to approximately 6.5 million individuals 
whose information was subject to unauthorized access and 
exfiltration in the November 2023 cybersecurity incident. The 
information associated with each individual varies, but the 
data as a whole includes information such as email and mailing 
addresses, phone numbers, birth dates, social security numbers 
and other identification numbers, usernames, passwords, 
financial and customer account numbers, policy numbers, 
salaries and personal medical information. However, not all 
of these individuals had all of this information accessed and 
exfiltrated. McCamish also identified corporate customers 
whose business data was subject to unauthorized access and 
exfiltration. McCamish has notified its impacted customers and 
intends to work with these customers to support their respective 
reporting obligations, as appropriate. McCamish’s review 
process is ongoing. 

Infosys has undertaken a review of its cybersecurity posture and 
threat landscape to build further fortification and to strengthen 
its cyber defense capabilities. As an organization, we continue to 
review and strengthen our cybersecurity processes and controls 
across our entire network in line with industry best practices.

its business approach. Our ability to fulfill and exceed 
our responsibilities to our stakeholders is a testament to 
our commitment. We have balanced our business success 
with an unwavering focus on exemplary governance and 
responsiveness to the needs of the environment and society. 
As an early proponent of responsible business, we readily 
embraced our commitment to integrate Environmental, 
Social and Governance (ESG) factors into our operations. 
We adopted the GRI Framework in 2008 and in fiscal 2013, 
we were among the first companies to publish the Business 
Responsibility Report (BRR). 

The BRSR follows the National Guidelines on Responsible 
Business Conduct (NGRBC) principles on the social, 
environmental and economic responsibilities of business. 

Our BRSR includes our responses to questions about our 
practices and performance on key principles defined by 
Regulation 34(2)(f) of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and 
Disclosure Requirements) Regulations 2015 as amended from 
time to time, which cover topics across the ESG dimensions.

towards the management of key HSE aspects. In line with our strategy, our HSEMS at all Indian locations is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard. At overseas locations, we have 
implemented processes based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions 
to address occupational health-related topics such as emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health 
centers are available at all our campuses in India. During the year, doctors and physiotherapists have helped employees and their families through virtual consultations leveraging 
our telemedicine portal. More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at  
https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

10b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis by the entity? 

We proactively identify occupational health and safety risks, for all existing / new / modified activities, processes, products or services, and regulatory changes, including routine 
and non-routine activities. Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination 
and control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are 
no product risks, but there are those related to the provision of services like ergonomics at work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employees’ commute. 
Participation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments. Risks are also assessed before and post the development of 
new buildings. Experience from previous projects and current operations is also considered. We continually monitor our construction sites where infrastructure is being established. 
More details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at  
https://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html.

12. Describe the measures taken by the entity to ensure a safe and healthy work place. 

Infosys acknowledges that Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) is one of the key aspects of sustainable business practices.  OH&S policies, processes, and practices at Infosys 
promote physical, mental, and social well-being of employees in the workplace. The robust Health and Safety Management system at Infosys has earned us the certification of 
ISO 45001:2018 for all Indian locations, including Infosys Limited and its subsidiaries, in line with our HSE strategy. 

The Company has the following measures to ensure a safe and healthy workplace: 
1. Incident management: Incidents which include near misses / potential hazards / accidents are reported through internal applications, supervisors, or mails and root 

causes of incidents are identified, analyzed and appropriate corrective actions are taken to avoid recurrence or occurrence of incidents leading to injuries / losses. 
2. OH&S Committee: Both employees and contract workers are a part of the Infosys OH&S Committee which helps in ensuring their active participation and consultation.   
3. Training and awareness: Training includes awareness building, mock drills, classroom sessions and periodic demonstrations. HSEMS training is a part of our employee 

induction program. To enable continuous learning, a HSE awareness module is available on Lex, our internal learning platform. Job-specific and generic trainings are 
conducted for contractual staff during induction and later through refresher trainings. 

4. Safety interventions: We have always focused on building a culture of safety at Infosys. The safety systems in place include work permits, trainings, Lock Out Tag Out 
(LOTO), safety inspections, audits, operational controls, and monitoring. Policies have been established focusing on specific areas such as women’s safety, lone working, 
transport, travel, construction, amongst others.  

5. Medical services: We have set up first aid centers on our campuses in India. Some of the first aid facilities are operational round the clock. Our telemedicine portal 
continues to operate and allows employees to consult the doctors at our occupational health centers in India online. Ambulance services are available at all our 
locations in India round the clock. 

6. Health Risk Assessment: HRA is carried out annually based on inputs from the OHC. Being an IT / ITES company, the prevalent risks include ergonomics, Musculoskeletal 
Disorders (MSDs), emotional well-being, etc., associated with workplace, operation of utilities, and commute. Numerous initiatives, interventions, engagement virtual 
sessions, and process controls are in place to address these risks. 

7. Programs on ergonomics: These include on-site physiotherapy centres, interventions by ergonomic experts and providing ergonomic infrastructure. 
8. Physical and emotional well-being: At our locations in India, we have dietitians to provide counseling and guidance. We have also set up state-of-the-art gyms to train 

physical and mental fitness. 
9. Programs for mothers: Pregna Care, a professional health care program is designed especially for expectant mothers and aims at providing maximum comfort to 

the mother. 
10. Working environment: We also focus on improving the work environment by monitoring indoor air quality, lux and noise levels and promoting the use of green 

seal chemicals.

Infosys has been carbon neutral since fiscal 2020 across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our approach to carbon neutrality is based on reducing and avoiding emissions through energy 
efficiency and renewable energy. Energy efficiency is achieved through super-efficient new buildings, industry-leading Energy Performance Index (EPI) <70 kWh/m2-yr, real-time 
monitoring and optimization of building operations through smart building systems, and retrofits in existing buildings. Infosys has implemented several retrofit projects (across 
air conditioning, lighting, and UPS systems) in the past and achieved a connected electrical load reduction of 36 MW across campuses in India. In fiscal 2024, we have undertaken 
a retrofit project to replace direct FCU units with chilled water units of air conditioning, which saved 1.1 lakh kWh and reduced emissions by 80.84 tCO2e. To achieve our goal of 
transitioning to clean energy, we have installed 60.2 MWp of solar PV capacity.

We seek to uphold our ambition of ‘zero waste to landfill’ through active minimization combined with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes. 
This year, we achieved TRUE Zero Waste Certification for our owned campuses in Bengaluru, Chennai Mcity and Pune Phase-2 through Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI). 

The e-waste is always sent back to original manufacturers (under buyback schemes) or authorized recyclers who provide us certificates on the successful recycling and recovery of 
the material. Other hazardous waste like biomedical waste, oil-soaked cotton, oil filters from DG sets, and other trash are designated by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) 
and the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). These agencies incinerate the waste in compliance with rules and regulations. The resulting ash is diverted for use in the production of 
cement in a few places and delivered to Treatment, Storage, Disposal Facility (TSDF) landfills for safe disposal.

Infosys has a Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) called Phoenix, certified by ISO 22301:2019 Security and Resilience – Business Continuity Management 
Standard. This program is designed to ensure seamless continuity of business and the utmost safety of employees and organization assets while continuously meeting 
client expectations. The BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining, and 
continually improving business continuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy. Infosys has a business continuity and disaster 
recovery plan called the Phoenix plan at the corporate level, and comprehensive business continuity plans are created at three operational levels covering business 
functions, locations, and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes 
and natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. This covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments 
for functions, locations, and accounts, which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in place. The management system has been continuously 
validated across levels through tests and exercises, and various incidents have been successfully tackled without any significant business continuity or employee safety 
impacts. An efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during disasters.

Standalone Financial Statements under Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) for the 
year ended March 31, 2024



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 205

Independent Auditor’s Report 
To The Members Of Infosys Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”), which comprise the 
Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2024, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes 
in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of 
material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Standalone Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Standalone Financial 
Statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view 
in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles 
generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2024 and its profit, total comprehensive income, 
changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SA”s) specified under 
Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit 
of the Standalone Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Standalone Financial 
Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements 
as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the 
matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24206

Standalone Financial Statements

Sr. No. Key Audit Matter

1 Revenue recognition

The Company’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The Company derives 
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings and business 
process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance 
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of 
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgment.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor 
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is 
recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when 
the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it obtains control of the 
specified goods or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it is primarily responsible 
for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or service, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to 
determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed 
through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method 
when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is 
not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of 
method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature 
of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, 
(2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue 
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion method, revenue recognition from these 
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.

Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the 
Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line 
basis or using the percentage-of-completion method included the following, among others:

• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) 
determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed-price 
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion 
method.

• We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:

 – Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents 
that were part of the agreement.

 – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) 
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) 
whether fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage-of-completion 
method.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 207

2 Revenue recognition – Fixed-price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage-of-completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended 
to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to 
measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total 
efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes 
based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the 
period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed-price contracts measured using the percentage-
of-completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and 
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This 
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred 
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the 
term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to 
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer to Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the Standalone Financial Statements.

 

Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the 
following, among others:

• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts 
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls 
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems, which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of 
efforts incurred.

• We selected a sample of fixed-price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and 
performed the following:

 – Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation 
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance 
obligations that have been fulfilled.

 – Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant 
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs 
or efforts to complete the contract.

 – Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off 
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts 
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Standalone Financial Statements

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included 
in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report, including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility and 
Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, 
Standalone Financial Statements and our Auditor’s Report thereon.

Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and, we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, 
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained 
during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of 
these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, including Other 
Comprehensive Income, Changes in Equity and Cash Flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally 
accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate 
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing 
and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and 
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that 
were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and 
presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error.

In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management and Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern 
basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so.

The Company’s Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating effectiveness 
of such controls.

•  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management.

•  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
Auditor’s Report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 
our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 209

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our Auditor’s Report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” to the Independent Auditor’s Report

(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of 
Infosys Limited of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of 
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the 
“Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the 
year ended on that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the 
essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and 
maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct 
of its business, including adherence to Company’s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds 
and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as 
required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial 
Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls 
Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the 
Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained 
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with 
reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone 
Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
Company’s internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
A Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A Company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper 
management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24212

Standalone Financial Statements

that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, an 
adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and such internal financial controls with reference 
to Standalone Financial Statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control 
with reference to Standalone Financial Statements established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control 
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of 
the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and 
relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where 
a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a 
revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in 
the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting 
policy information used in preparation of the audited Standalone 
financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.

As the year to date figures are taken from the source and 
rounded to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the 
previous quarters might not always add up to the year to date 
figures reported in this statement.

1.3 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity 
with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, 
judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and 
assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period. The application of accounting policies that 
require critical accounting estimates involving complex and 
subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these 

financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.4. 
Accounting estimates could change from period to period. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate 
changes in estimates are made as management becomes aware 
of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes 
in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial 
statements in the period in which changes are made and, if 
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Standalone 
financial statements.

1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Company’s contracts with customers include promises to 
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues 
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and 
measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, 
by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are 
committed to perform their respective obligations under the 
contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company 
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies 
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of 
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables 
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from 
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these 
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a 
straight-line basis when services are performed through an 
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. 
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized 
ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer 
and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of the contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the 
maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the 
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

The Company uses the percentage-of-completion method 
in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to 
determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a 
proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. 
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between 
input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs 
involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the 
period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest 
available information.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company 
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24230

Standalone Financial Statements

or services before they are transferred to the customer. The 
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for 
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, 
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine 
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, 
is acting as a principal or an agent.

Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

b. Income taxes
The Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the 
United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions.

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision 
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / 
recovered for uncertain tax positions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the 
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which 
the temporary differences become deductible. Management 
considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax 
liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning 
strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of 
historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax 
assets are deductible, management believes that the Company 
will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The 
amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, 
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of 
future taxable income during the carry forward period are 
reduced. Refer to Note 2.17.

c. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion 
of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of 
periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate 
of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual 
value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values 
of Company's assets are determined by the Management 
at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, 
including at each financial year end. The lives are based on 
historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation 
of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in 
technology. Refer to Note 2.1.

2. Notes to the Standalone financial statements

2.1 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly 
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, 
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the 
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation 
is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected 

useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The Company depreciates property, plant and equipment over 
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method.

The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

Building(1) 22-25 years

Plant and machinery(1) 5 years

Office equipment 5 years

Computer equipment(1) 3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures(1) 5 years

Vehicles(1) 5 years

Leasehold improvements Lower of useful life of the asset 
or lease term

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the useful 
lives as given above best represent the period over which Management 
expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these assets is 
different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of 
the Companies Act 2013.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The 
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets 
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the 
cost of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed 
under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures 
relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only 
when it is probable that future economic benefits associated 
with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated 
depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon 
sale or retirement of the asset.

Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined 
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by 
the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the 
estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss 
is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been 
a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable 
amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its 
revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not 
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined 
(net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss 
been recognized for the asset in prior years.

2.2.2 Other intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective 
individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an 
identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other 
economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures 
required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically 
including at each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and 
commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability 
to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs, which can be capitalized include the cost of 
material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

2.3 Leases 
Accounting policy
The Company as a lessee 
The Company’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for 
land, buildings and computers. The Company assesses whether 
a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange 
for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right 
to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses 
whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset 
(ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits 
from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the 
Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company 
recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease 
liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except 
for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) 
and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, 
the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend 
or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably 
certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected 
lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses 
whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or 
terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease 
term, the Company considers factors, such as any significant 
leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs 

relating to the termination of the lease and the importance 
of the underlying asset to Infosys’s operations taking into 
account the location of the underlying asset and the availability 
of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is 
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current 
economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which 
comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for 
any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date 
of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. 
They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement 
date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term 
and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are 
evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not 
be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the 
recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to 
sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 235

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the 
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if 
not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates 
in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are 
remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right 
of use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it 
will exercise an extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in 
the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.

The Company as a lessor
Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a finance 
or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, 
the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are 
classified as operating leases.

When the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for 
its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The 
sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference 
to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a  
straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

The changes in the carrying value of right-of-use assets for the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:

using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration recognized in a business combination, which is 
subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.

(v) Investment in subsidiaries

Investment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate 
financial statements.

b. Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
The counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.

This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities 
which are not designated as hedges.

Although the Company believes that these derivatives 
constitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may 
not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial 
Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as 
hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is 
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value 
through profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially 
at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized 
in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. 
Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured 
at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange 
gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in 
this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities 
if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized 
within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

(ii) Cash flow hedge

The Company designates certain foreign exchange forward 
and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate 
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable 
forecast cash transactions.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative 
is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated 
in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of 
changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized 

immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued 
prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the 
hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedge reserve till 
the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedge 
reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve 
is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the 
forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the 
amount accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to 
net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments
The Company derecognizes a financial asset when the 
contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset 
expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies 
for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a 
part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Company's 
Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged or cancelled or expires.

2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments
In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the 
Company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are 
based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting 
date. The methods used to determine fair value include 
discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market 
multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All 
methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation 
of value, and such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the 
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one 
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair 
value, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the 
short maturity of these instruments.

2.11.5 Impairment
The Company recognizes loss allowances using the expected 
credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled 
revenues which are not fair valued through profit or loss. 
Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues 
with no significant financing component is measured at an 
amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, 
expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to 
the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase 
in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are 
measured at lifetime ECL.

The Company determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current 
and estimated future economic conditions. The Company 
considers current and anticipated future economic conditions 
relating to industries the Company deals with and the 
countries where it operates.

amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Fair value hierarchy
Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year ended March 31, 2023, tax-free bonds and government securities of ₹383 crore were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 of 
fair value hierarchy since these were valued based on quoted price. Further, non-convertible debentures of ₹1,611 crore were transferred 
from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on market observable inputs.

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used 
in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a 
significant impact in its value.

Majority of investments of the Company are fair valued based 
on Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily 
include investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity 
fund units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible 
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi-
government organizations. The Company invests after 
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria, 
including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, 
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's 
risk management program.

Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial 
risks – market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's 
primary focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial 

markets and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its 
financial performance. The primary market risk to the Company 
is foreign exchange risk. The Company uses derivative financial 
instruments to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. 
The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the 
individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration 
of risk from the top few customers.

Market risk
The Company operates internationally and a major portion of 
the business is transacted in several currencies and consequently 
the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through 
its sales and services in the United States and elsewhere, and 
purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. 
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as 
foreign exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the 
risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. 
The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and foreign 
currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may 
fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the results of 
the Company’s operations are adversely affected as the rupee 
appreciates / depreciates against these currencies.

Derivative financial instruments
The Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of 
changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative 
financial instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or 
indirectly observable in the marketplace.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the 
Company has designated certain foreign exchange forward 
and option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk 
of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast 
cash transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance 
in cash flow hedge reserve as at March 31, 2024 are expected 
to occur and reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss 
within three months.

The Company determines the existence of an economic 
relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item 
based on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted 
cash flows. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception 
of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective 
effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic 
relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument, including whether the hedging instrument is 
expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items.

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer 
optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged 
and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the 
volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged 
item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk 
management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated 
and accounted for in the Statement of Profit or Loss at the time of 
the hedge relationship rebalancing.

The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows:

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the 
counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure 
to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade 
receivables amounting to ₹25,152 crore and 
₹20,773 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 
respectively and unbilled revenue amounting to ₹10,814 crore 
and ₹12,384 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 
respectively. Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically 
unsecured and are derived from revenue from customers 
majorly located in the United States of America and Europe. 
Credit risk has always been managed by the Company through 
credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously 
monitoring the creditworthiness of the customers to which the 
Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. 
The Company uses the expected credit loss model to assess any 
required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the 
expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled 
revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other 
related credit information to the extent available.

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly 
by the individual characteristic of each customer and the 
concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure 
to customers is diversified and there is no single customer 
contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables 
and unbilled revenues.

The details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from 
top five customers and top ten customers are as follows:

(In %)

Particulars Year ended March 31,

2024 2023

Revenue from top five customers 11.6 11.3

Revenue from top ten customers 18.9 19.6

Credit risk exposure

The Company's credit period generally ranges from 30-75 days.

The allowance for lifetime expected credit loss on customer 
balances recognized for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is ₹108 crore and ₹139 crore, respectively.

The movement in credit loss allowance on customer 
balance is as follows:

(In ₹ crore)

(reversed), net  108  139

Amounts written off  (93)  (145)

Translation differences  7  32
Balance at the end  721  699

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written 
off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic 
prospect of recovery.

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the 
Company generally invest in deposits with banks with high 
ratings assigned by international and domestic credit rating 
agencies. Ratings are monitored periodically and the Company 
has considered the latest available credit ratings as at the date of 
approval of these financial statements.

The investments of the Company primarily include investment 
in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund units, 
tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, 
treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible 
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and quasi 
government organizations. The Company invests after 
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria 
including Tier I Capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, credit rating, 
profitability, NPA levels and deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group’s 
risk management program.

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be 
able to settle or meet its obligations on time.

The Company's principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash 
equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations. 
The Company has no outstanding borrowings. The Company

liability towards cash-settled, share-based payments was ₹13 crore and ₹4 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and 
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.

The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected 
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of 
the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the 
options. Expected volatility of the comparative Company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of 
their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated 
between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions:

2.16 Provisions
Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the 
Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that 
is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of 
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the liability.

a. Post-sales client support

The Company provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales 
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs 
associated with such support services are accrued at the time 
related revenues are recorded in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss. The Company estimates such costs based on historical 
experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any 
material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.

b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, 
if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in 
which such losses become probable based on the estimated 
efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is 
measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of 
continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, 
the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets 
associated with that contract.

services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues 
and are expected to be utilized over a period of one year.

2.17 Income taxes
Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. 
Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items 
recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in 
equity or other comprehensive income. Current income tax for 
current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected 
to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences 
arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax 
benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences 
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes 
in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
recognized as income or expense in the period that includes 
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred 
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. 
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that 
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in 
the foreseeable future.

The Company offsets current tax assets and current tax 
liabilities; deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where 
it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized 
amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, 
or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. 
Tax benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee 
share options in excess of compensation charged to income 
are credited to equity.

Income tax expense  8,719  8,375

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the year 
ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 34.94%.

Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹913 
crore and ₹116 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to 
prior periods is primarily on account of adjudication of certain 
disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of 
assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, 
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment 
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders 
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment 
of certain contentious matters. As a result interest income (pre-
tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income 
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding 
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution 
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been 
reduced from contingent liabilities.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable 
overseas, principally in the United States. In India, the Company 
has benefited from certain income tax incentives that the 
Government of India had provided for export of software and 
services from the units registered under the Special Economic 
Zones Act (SEZs), 2005. SEZ units, which began the provision 
of services on or after April 1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction 
of 100% of profits or gains derived from the export of services 
for the first five years from the financial year in which the unit 
commenced the provision of services and 50% of such profits 
or gains for further five years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains 
is also available for a further five years subject to creation of a 
Special Economic Zone re-investment Reserve out of the profit 
for the eligible SEZ units and utilization of such reserve by the 
Company for acquiring new plant and machinery for the purpose 
of its business as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 
1961. (Refer to Special Economic Zone Re-investment reserve 
under Note 2.12 Equity).

Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 substantially relates to origination and reversal of 
temporary differences.

Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to 
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater 
than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the 
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
As at March 31, 2024, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to 
approximately ₹7,844 crore. As at March 31, 2024, the Company 
has a deferred tax liability for branch profit tax of ₹269 crore (net 
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits 
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on 
temporary differences amounting to ₹10,776 crore and 
₹10,948 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 
respectively, associated with investments in subsidiaries and 
branches as the Company is able to control the timing of reversal 
of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The 
Company majorly intends to repatriate earnings from subsidiaries 
and branches only to the extent these can be distributed 
in a tax-free manner.

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on 
accumulated losses of ₹1,358 crore each as at March 31, 2024 
and March 31, 2023, respectively as it is probable that future 
taxable profit will not be available against which the unused tax 
losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. Majority of the 
accumulated losses as at March 31, 2023 will expire between 
financial years 2028 to 2030.

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, management believes that the Company will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount 
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, 
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable 
income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired 
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and 
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best 
estimate determined based on the expected value method.

2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Company derives revenues primarily from IT services 
comprising software development and related services, cloud 
and infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and 
package implementation, licensing of software products and 
platforms across the Company’s core and digital offerings 
(together called as “software-related services”). Contracts with 
customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-
price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for 
recognition and measurement when the contract has been 
approved in writing, by the parties, to the contract, the parties to 
contract are committed to perform their respective obligations 
under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. 
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised 
products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has 
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products 
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as 
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such 
uncertainty is resolved.

The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and 
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling 
price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when 
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling 
price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method 
used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost 
plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost 
of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an 
appropriate margin based on similar services.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 265

The Company’s contracts may include variable consideration 
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The 
Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction 
price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount 
of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a 
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will 
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable 
consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work-based contracts, 
are recognized as the related services are performed.  
Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either 
on a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period 
or ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer 
and Company’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations 
are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to 
determine progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards 
completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to 
date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs 
or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts 
are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and 
are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates 
change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the 
estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the 
contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on 
incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such 
losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs 
to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic 
performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress 
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled 
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (which we refer to as "unearned revenues").

In arrangements for software development and related 
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue 
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, 
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria 
for considering software development and related services as 
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction 
price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each 
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone 
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when 
sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling 
price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the 
standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost 
plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling 
price. For software development and related services, the 
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services 
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the 
work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include 
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific 

accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts 
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting 
guidance. In such arrangements where the Company is 
able to determine that hardware and services are distinct 
performance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these 
performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price 
basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company 
uses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating 
the standalone selling price. When such arrangements are 
considered as a single performance obligation, revenue 
is recognized over the period and measure of progress is 
determined based on promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right 
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license 
is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses 
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized 
over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have 
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical 
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in 
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license 
and implementation have been identified as two distinct 
separate performance obligations, the transaction price for 
such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of 
the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. 
In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, 
the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach 
in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license 
is required to be substantially customized as part of the 
implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license 
and implementation is considered to be a single performance 
obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method as the implementation is performed. 
Revenue from client training, support and other services arising 
due to the sale of software products is recognized as the 
performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized 
ratably on a straight line basis over the period in which the 
services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company 
first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 
or services before they are transferred to the customer. The 
Company considers whether it is primarily responsible for 
fulfilling the promise to provide the specified goods or services, 
inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine 
whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, 
is acting as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both 
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. 
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct 
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate 
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone 
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and

creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone 
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct 
performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing 
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs 
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not 
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Company 
expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition 
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate 
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when 
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate 
or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in 
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are 
expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to 
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs 
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life 
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or 
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs 
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are 
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating 
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of 
the capitalized costs.

The Company presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is as follows:

(In ₹ crore)

Particulars Year ended March 31,

2024 2023

Revenue from software services  1,28,637  1,23,755

Revenue from products and 
platforms  296  259

Total revenue from operations  1,28,933  1,24,014

Products and platforms

The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and 
platforms, including Infosys Applied AI, which applies next-
generation AI and machine learning.

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for 
the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 56% 
and 55%, respectively.

Trade receivables and contract balances

The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections 
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue 
on the Company’s Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed as work 
progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, 
either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon 
achievement of contractual milestones.

The Company’s receivables are rights to consideration that 
are unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in 
excess of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-
price maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset 
when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only 
after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on 
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of 
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to 
the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed-price 
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset 
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion 
of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.

Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of 
impairment in the Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the 
Company recognized revenue of ₹4,189 crore and ₹4,391 crore 
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2023 and 
April 1, 2022, respectively.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, ₹6,396 
crore and ₹5,378 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining to other 
fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as of April 1, 2023 and 
April 1, 2022, respectively has been reclassified to trade receivables 
upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.

Remaining performance obligation disclosure

The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the 
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized 
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as 
to when the Company expects to recognize these amounts in 
revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 
115, the Company has not disclosed the remaining performance 
obligation related disclosures for contracts where the revenue 
recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer 
of the entity's performance completed to date, typically those 
contracts where invoicing is on time-and-material and unit 
of work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation 
estimates are subject to change and are affected by several 
factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of 
contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has 
not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

The aggregate value of performance obligations that are 
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other 
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is 
₹80,334 crore. Out of this, the Company expects to recognize 
revenue of around 53.7% within the next one year and the 
remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance 
obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at 
March 31, 2023 was ₹70,680 crore. The contracts can generally 
be terminated by the customers and typically includes an 
enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, 
customers have not terminated contracts without cause.

are translated into the relevant functional currency at exchange 
rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains or losses 
resulting from such translations are recognized in the Statement 
of Profit and Loss and reported within exchange gains / (losses) 
on translation of assets and liabilities, net, except when deferred 
in Other Comprehensive Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated 
in a foreign currency and measured at fair value are translated at 
the exchange rate prevalent at the date when the fair value was 
determined. Non-monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency and measured at historical 
cost are translated at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of

reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them shall 
be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government 
grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are 
recognized in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss 
on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of the 
asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized on 
a systematic basis in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and 
Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the related 
costs which they are intended to compensate.

2.21 Employee benefits
Accounting policy
2.21.1 Gratuity and pensions

The Company provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement 
plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible Indian employees. 
The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment to vested 
employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of 
employment, of an amount based on the respective employee's 
salary and the tenure of employment with the Company. The 
Company contributes gratuity liabilities to the Infosys Limited 
Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust ("the Trust"). Trustees administer 
contributions made to the Trusts and contributions are invested 
in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as 
permitted by Indian law.

The Company operates defined benefit pension plan in certain 
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. 
These plans are managed by third-party fund managers. The 
plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a 

lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes 
death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require 
contributions, which are based on a percentage of salary that 
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.

Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external 
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the 
Company to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market risk.

The Company recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit 
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses 
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability 
/ (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The 
actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields 
computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive 
income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net 
profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.21.2 Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident 
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee 
and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident 
fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered 
employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the 
Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The Trust 
invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian 
law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government 
administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest 
is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered 
by the Government. The Company has an obligation to 
make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the 
investments of the Trust and the notified interest rate.

2.21.3 Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys are participants in a defined 
contribution plan. The Company has no further obligations to 
the Plan beyond its monthly contributions, which are periodically 
contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of which is invested with 
the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

2.21.4 Compensated absences

The Company has a policy on compensated absences which 
are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The 
expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is 
determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external 
actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered 
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government 
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision 
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been 
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-
employment benefit obligation.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 271

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance 
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to 
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and 
other relevant data.

The Company assesses all the above assumptions 
with its projected long-term plans of growth and 
prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards 
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund 
Trust. Trustees administer contributions made to the trust. 
The plan assets of the overseas defined benefit plan have 
been primarily invested in insurer managed funds and the 
asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the 
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations 
applicable to pension funds and the insurer managers. The 
insurers' investment are diversified and provide for guaranteed 
interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurement) of the gratuity 
plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were 
₹125 crore and ₹111 crore, respectively and for the pension plan 
were ₹21 crore and (₹44) crore, respectively.

The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law. 
The details of major plan assets into various categories as at 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows:

These defined benefit plans expose the Company to actuarial risk 
which are set out below:

Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined 
by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas 
jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond 
yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund 
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump 
sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for 
converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that 
the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates 
and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return 
implied by these conversion rates.

Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in 
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the 
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible 
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified 
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund 
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on 
members’ account balances.

The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of 
defined benefit obligation is as follows :

(In ₹ crore)

Impact from As at March 31, 2024

1% point 
increase / 
decrease

0.5% point 
increase /

Discount rate 102 28

Weighted average rate of increase in

Sensitivity for significant actuarial assumptions is computed 
by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation, 
keeping all other actuarial assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is not probable, and changes in some of the 
assumptions may be correlated.

The Company expects to contribute ₹300 crore to gratuity and 
₹27 crore to pension during the fiscal 2025.

  (138)  104

The assumptions used in determining the present value 
obligation of the defined benefit plan under the Deterministic 
Approach are as follows:

Particulars  As at March 31,

2024 2023

Government of India (GoI) bond yield (1) 7.00% 7.10%

Expected rate of return on plan assets 8.20% 8.15%

Remaining term to maturity of 
portfolio  6 years  6 years

Expected guaranteed interest rate 8.25% 8.15%

(1) In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not 
developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount 
rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-
term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the 
average estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

The breakup of the plan assets into various categories as at  
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows:

(In %)

Particulars  As at March 31,

2024 2023

Central and state government bonds 60 60

Public sector undertakings and 
Private sector bonds

30 33

Others 10 7

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the 
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations.

The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Company to 
interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a 
discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2024, the defined benefit obligation would 
be affected by approximately ₹66 crore and ₹110 crore on 
account of 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of 
return on plan assets.

The Company contributed ₹1,100 crore and ₹1,053 crore to the 
provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023, respectively. The same has been recognized in 
the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss under the head 
employee benefit expense.

The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a 
salary in Indian rupees.

Employee benefits cost include:

(Refer to Note 2.12).

2.22 Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares used in 
computing earnings per equity share
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net 
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the 
Company by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also 
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at 
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity 
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity 
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for 
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by 
the Board of Directors.

A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of 
basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows:

Particulars Year ended March 31,

2024 2023

Basic earnings per equity share 
– weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding 415,00,99,796 419,38,13,881

Effect of dilutive common 
equivalent shares – share 
options outstanding 38,94,828 44,20,497

Diluted earnings per equity 
share – weighted average 
number of equity shares and 
common equivalent shares 
outstanding 415,39,94,624 419,82,34,378

For the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, there 
were 47,395 and 271 options to purchase equity shares, which 
had an anti-dilutive effect.

2.23 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or 
non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from 
past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company financial position and results of 
operations.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24288

Independent Auditor’s Report 
To The Members of Infosys Limited

Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries 
(the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the “Group”) which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at March 
31, 2024, and the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of 
Changes in Equity and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and notes to the financial statements, 
including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the “Consolidated 
Financial Statements”).

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid Consolidated Financial 
Statements, give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair 
view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting 
principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at March 31, 2024 and their consolidated 
profit, their consolidated total comprehensive income, their consolidated changes in equity and their consolidated cash flows for the 
year ended on that date.

Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (“SAs”) specified under 
section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit 
of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics 
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of 
the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other 
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained 
by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Emphasis of Matter
As described in note 2.24.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain costs relating to possible damages or claims relating to a 
cybersecurity incident in a subsidiary are indeterminable as at the date of this report because of reasons stated in the note. Our opinion 
is not modified in respect of this matter.

Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have 
determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 289

Sr. No. Key Audit Matter

1 Revenue recognition

The Group’s contracts with customers include contracts with multiple products and services. The group derives 
revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings and business 
process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance 
obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of 
the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.

In certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor 
equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is 
recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group 
is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods 
or services before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether 
it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize 
the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

As certain contracts with customers involve management’s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, 
(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue 
is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these 
judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.

Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the 
Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis 
or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:

• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) 
determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price 
maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method.

• We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:

 – Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents 
that were part of the agreement.

 – Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management’s conclusions regarding the (i) 
identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) 
whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion 
method.

Sr. No. Key Audit Matter

2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method

Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through 
an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date 
as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure 
progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts 
or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on 
the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in 
which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

We identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of 
completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and 
is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This 
estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred 
to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the 
term of the contracts.

This required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to 
evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.

Refer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

Auditor’s Response

Principal Audit Procedures Performed included the following:

Our audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the 
following, among others:

• We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts 
or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls 
pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of 
efforts incurred.

• We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and 
performed the following:

 – Evaluated management’s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation 
by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance 
obligations that have been fulfilled.

 – Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group’s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant 
variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs 
or efforts to complete the contract.

 – Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off 
from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts 
to complete the remaining performance obligations.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 291

Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information comprises the 
information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s Report, Business 
Responsibility and Sustainability Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does not include the consolidated 
financial statements, standalone financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, consider 
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during 
the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to 
report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation and 
presentation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated 
financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group 
in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including Ind AS specified under section 133 of the Act. The 
respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting 
records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for preventing and detecting frauds 
and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the 
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have 
been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are 
responsible for assessing the ability of the respective entities to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to 
going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Boards of Directors either intends to liquidate their 
respective entities or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The respective Boards of Directors/Trustees of the entities included in the Group are also responsible for overseeing the financial 
reporting process of the Group.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high 
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement 
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could 
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism 
throughout the audit. We also:

• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design 
and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

• Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company 
and its subsidiary companies which are companies incorporated in India, has adequate internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the management.

• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence 
obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the 
Group to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our 
auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24292

our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events 
or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and 
whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair 
presentation.

• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the Group to express an 
opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the consolidated financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it 
probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the consolidated financial statements may be influenced. 
We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our 
work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the consolidated financial statements.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial 
statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and 
significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal financial controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in 
our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we 
determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be 
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annexure “A” To The Independent Auditor’s Report
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to the Members of 
Infosys Limited of even date)

Report on the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements under Clause (i) of 
sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024, 
we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of INFOSYS LIMITED (hereinafter 
referred to as the “Company”) and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The respective Boards of Directors of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are 
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria 
established by the respective Companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on 
Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the “ICAI”). 
These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating 
effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the 
safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, 
and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in 
accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements. Those Standards and the 
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if 
such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference 
to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to 
consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated 
financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the 
internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are 
companies incorporated in India.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24296

Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements 
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; 
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the 
possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not 
be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to 
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements may become 
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary 
companies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system with 
reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements 
were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the criteria for internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial 
statements established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance 
Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
Accounting policy
Cash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby profit for the year is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash 
nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expenses associated with 
investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated. The 
Group considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash to be cash equivalents.

3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 
and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.

Accounting policies have been consistently applied except 
where a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted 
or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a 
change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material 
accounting policy information used in preparation of the 
audited Consolidated financial statements have been discussed in 
the respective notes.

As the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded 
to the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous 
quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures 
reported in this statement.

1.3 Basis of consolidation
Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. 
The Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its 
subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over 
the entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those 

Overview and notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated 
through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant 
activities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences 
until the date control ceases.

The financial statements of the Group companies are 
consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances 
and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such 
transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial 
statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies 
in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent 
part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries 
that are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the 
Company, are excluded.

Refer to Note 2.25 for the list of subsidiaries and controlled 
trusts of the Company.

1.4 Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with 
Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments 
and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions 
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated financial 
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the period. The application of accounting policies that 
require critical accounting estimates involving complex and 
subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these 
financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting 
estimates could change from period to period. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in 
estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of 
changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes 
in estimates and judgments are reflected in the financial 
statements in the period in which changes are made and, if 
material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to 
the Consolidated financial statements.

1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to 
transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues 
from customer contracts are considered for recognition and 
measurement when the contract has been approved, in 
writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract 
are committed to perform their respective obligations under 
the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group 
assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies 
distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of 
distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables 
and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from 
such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these 
distinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 309

Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a 
straight-line basis when services are performed through an 
indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. 
Revenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized 
ratably using a percentage of completion method when the 
pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer 
and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through 
the period of the contract because the services are generally 
discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to 
recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment 
and is based on the promises in the contract and nature 
of the deliverables.

The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method 
in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the 
percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to 
determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a 
proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. 
Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress 
towards completion as there is a direct relationship between 
input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs 
involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the 
period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest 
available information.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is 
the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first 
evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or 
services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group 
considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory 
risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it 
controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting 
as a principal or an agent.

Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts 
are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable 
based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.

b. Income taxes
The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United 
States, though the Company also files tax returns in other 
overseas jurisdictions.

Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision 
for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / 
recovered for uncertain tax positions.

In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the 
Management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 

income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount 
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, 
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable 
income during the carry forward period are reduced. 
Also, refer to Note 2.17.

c. Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, 
Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires us to fair value 
identifiable intangible assets and contingent consideration 
to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations are 
conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required 
to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, 
value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These 
measurements are based on information available at the 
acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions 
that have been deemed reasonable by management (Refer to 
Note 2.1 and 2.4.2).

d. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion 
of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic 
depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an 
asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at 
the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Group's 
assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset 
is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial 
year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar 
assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact 
their life, such as changes in technology. Also, refer to Note 2.2.

e. Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and 
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For 
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups 
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and 
which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes.

The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher 
of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell. Key assumptions 
in the cash flow projections are prepared based on current 
economic conditions and comprises estimated long-term growth 
rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating 
margins. Also, refer to Note 2.4.1.

2. Notes to the Consolidated financial statements

2.1 Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations have been accounted for using the 
acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, 
Business Combinations.



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24310

The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value 
of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date 
on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price 
also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured 
initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent 
consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date 
and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially 
measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ 
proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-
acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount 
of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at 
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of 
subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.

Business combinations between entities under common 
control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated 
financial statements.

The payments related to options issued by the Group over the 
non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as 
financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated 
present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently 
measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable 
under the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. 
In the event that the option expires unexercised, the 
liability is derecognized.

Acquisitions during the year ended March 31, 2023
During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Group completed two 
business combinations to complement its digital offerings by 
acquiring 100% voting interests in:

(i) oddity GmbH, oddity group services GmbH, oddity space 
GmbH, oddity jungle GmbH, oddity code GmbH and oddity 
waves GmbH (collectively known as oddity), a Germany-
based digital marketing, experience, and commerce 
agencies on April 20, 2022.

(ii) BASE life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the 
life Science industry in Europe on September 1, 2022.

These acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group’s 
creative, branding and experience design capabilities and 
augment the Group’s life sciences expertise, scales its digital 
transformation capabilities with cloud-based industry solutions 
and expand its presence across Europe.

The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed based upon determination of fair values at the dates of 
acquisition is as follows :

Total  103  248  351

Goodwill    630

Total purchase price    981

(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of ₹26 crore

The excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value 
of assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill. The primary 
items that generated this goodwill are the value of the acquired 
assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which 
qualify as an intangible asset.

Goodwill is not tax-deductible. Goodwill pertaining to these 
business combinations is allocated to operating segments as 
more fully described in Note 2.4.1.

The purchase consideration of ₹981 crore includes cash of 
₹936 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair 
value of ₹45 crore as on the date of acquisition.

At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of 
the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities 
assigned towards achievement of financial targets and 
discount rate of 12.5%. As of March 31, 2024, the contingent 
consideration was fully paid.

Additionally, these acquisitions have shareholder and employee 
retention bonus payable to the employees of the acquiree 
over three years, subject to their continuous employment with 
the Group along with achievement of financial targets for the 
respective years. Performance and retention bonus is recognized 
in employee benefit expenses in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss over the period of service.

Fair value of trade receivables acquired, is ₹111 crore as 
of acquisition date and as of March 31, 2024, the amounts 
are fully collected.

Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with 
a business combination such as finder’s fees, legal fees, due 
diligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are 
expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹7 crore related 
to the acquisition have been included under administrative 
expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the 
year ended March 31, 2023.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 311

Proposed acquisitions
On January 11, 2024, Infosys Limited entered into a definitive 
agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital in InSemi 
Technology Services Private Limited, a semiconductor design 
services company headquartered in India, for a consideration 
including earn-outs, and management incentives and retention 
bonuses totaling up to ₹280 crore (approximately $34 million), 
subject to customary closing adjustments.

On April 18, 2024, Infosys Germany GmBH, a wholly-owned step 
down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, entered into a definitive 
agreement to acquire 100% of the equity share capital in in-tech 
Holding GmbH, leading provider of Engineering R&D services 
headquartered in Germany, for a consideration including earn-
outs amounting up to EUR 450 million (approximately 
₹4,045 crore), subject to customary closing adjustments.

2.2 Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly 
attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, 
plant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the 
Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is 
derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected 
useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. 
The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over 
their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The 
estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:

Buildings (1) 22-25 years

Plant and machinery (1)(2) 5 years

Office equipment 5 years

Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years

Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years

Vehicles(1) 5 years

Leasehold improvements Lower of useful life of the asset 
or lease term

(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the 
useful lives as given above best represent the period over which the 
Management expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for 
these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of 
Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013

(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The 
useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets 
as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their 
life, such as changes in technology.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and 
equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified 
as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost 
of assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under 
‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating 
to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is 
probable that future economic benefits associated with these 
will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured 
reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation 
are eliminated from the financial statements upon sale or 
retirement of the asset.

Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their 
carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of 
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of 
the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined 
on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate 
cash flows that are largely independent of those from other 
assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for 
the CGU to which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the 
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated 
depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the 
asset in prior years.

2.4 Goodwill and other intangible assets
2.4.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of 
the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, 
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. 
When the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, 
the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain 
purchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is 
measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

Impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and 
whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a 
Cash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For 
the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups 
of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and 
which represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
for internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest 
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are 
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or 
group of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of 
a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable 
amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the 
higher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. 
Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected 
to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow 
projections are prepared based on current economic conditions 
and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted 
average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.

A summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill 
is as follows :

(In ₹ crore)

Particulars As at March 31, 

2024 2023

Carrying value at the beginning  7,248  6,195

Goodwill on acquisitions 
(Refer to Note 2.1)  –  630

Translation differences  55  423

Carrying value at the end  7,303  7,248

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in 
a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of 
CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The 
Group internally reviews the goodwill for impairment at the 
operating segment level, after allocation of the goodwill to 
CGUs or groups of CGUs.

The allocation of goodwill to operating segments as at 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

(In ₹ crore)

Segment As at March 31,

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 315

The goodwill pertaining to Panaya amounting to ₹972 crore and 
₹959 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively 
is tested for impairment at the entity level.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair value 
less cost to sell and its value-in-use. The fair value of a CGU is 
determined based on the market capitalization. Value-in-use 
is determined based on discounted future cash flows. The key 
assumptions used for the calculations are as follows :

(In %)

Particulars As at March 31,

2024 2023

Long-term growth rate 7-10 8-10

Operating margins 19-21 19-21

Discount rate 13 13

The above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost 
of Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2024, the 
estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying 
amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to 
cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of 
the cash generating units.

2.4.2 Intangible assets
Accounting policy
Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their 
respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-
line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The 
estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based 
on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, 
demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the 
stability of the industry, and known technological advances) 

and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain 
the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization 
methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at 
each financial year end.

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product 
development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical 
and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future 
economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and 
ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can 
be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include 
the cost of material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly 
attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

Impairment
Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying 
amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment 
testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair 
value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an 
individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash 
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In 
such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to 
which the asset belongs.

If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to 
be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the 
assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. 
An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used 
to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount 
of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, 
provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount 
that would have been determined (net of any accumulated 
amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the 
asset in prior years.

The changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2024 are as follows :

as a part of transformation project which is not considered as distinct 
goods or services and the control related to the assets is not transferred 
to the Group in accordance with Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with 
Customers. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a reduction to 
the total contract value and accounted as Deferred contract cost. The 
Group has entered into financing arrangements with a third party for 
these assets. As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the financial liability 
pertaining to such arrangements amounts to ₹372 crore and ₹731 crore, 
respectively. For the year ended March 31, 2023, ₹118 crore was settled 
directly by the third party to the customer on behalf of the Group and 
accordingly considered as non-cash transaction (Refer to Note 2.13)

Withholding taxes and others primarily consist of input tax 
credits and Cenvat recoverable from Government of India.

2.11 Financial instruments
Accounting policy
2.11.1 Initial recognition
The Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities 
when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the 
instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized 
at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables 
which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction 
costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue 
of financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair 
value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial 
recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are 
accounted for at trade date.

2.11.2 Subsequent measurement
a. Non-derivative financial instruments
(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost

A financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost 
if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold 
the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the 
contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified 
dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and 
interest on the principal amount outstanding.

(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI)

A financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model 
whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash 
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are 
solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount 
outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for its 



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24322

investments which are classified as equity instruments to present 
the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive 
income based on its business model.

(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through 
profit or loss (FVTPL)

A financial asset which is not classified in any of the above 
categories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.

(iv) Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost 
using the effective interest method, except for contingent 
consideration and financial liability under option arrangements 
recognized in a business combination which is subsequently 
measured at fair value through profit or loss.

b. Derivative financial instruments
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign 
exchange forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of 
changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The 
counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.

(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value 
through profit or loss.

This category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities 
which are not designated as hedges.

Although the Group believes that these derivatives constitute 
hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify 
for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. 
Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or 
is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is 
categorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value 
through profit or loss.

Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at 
fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in 
net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when 
incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are 
measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting 
exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / 
liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current 
liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be 
realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

(ii) Cash flow hedge

The Group designates certain foreign exchange forward 
and options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate 
the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable 
forecast cash transactions.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value 
of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any 
ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative 
is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting 
is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires 
or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging 

reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in 
cash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction 
occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in 
the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit 
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the 
occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount 
accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net 
profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments
The Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or 
it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for 
derecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a 
financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet 
when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or 
cancelled or expires.

2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments
In determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the 
Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based 
on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. 
The methods used to determine fair value include discounted 
cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, 
available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of 
assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and 
such value may never actually be realized.

Refer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the 
disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and 
liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one 
year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair 
value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the 
short maturity of these instruments.

2.11.5 Impairment
The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit 
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue 
which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance 
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant 
financing component is measured at an amount equal to 
lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at 
an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a 
significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which 
case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

The Group determines the allowance for credit losses 
based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect 
current and estimated future economic conditions. The 
Group considers current and anticipated future economic 
conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the 
countries where it operates.

The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss 
allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required 
to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss or gain in 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) 
or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3 – Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

During the year ended March 31, 2023, government securities 
and tax-free bonds of ₹383 crore were transferred from Level 2 to 
Level 1 of fair value hierarchy, since these were valued based on 
quoted price. Further, non-convertible debentures of ₹1,611 crore 
were transferred from Level 1 to Level 2 of fair value hierarchy, 
since these were valued based on market observable inputs.

A one percentage point change in the unobservable inputs used 
in fair valuation of Level 3 assets and liabilities does not have a 
significant impact in its value.

Majority of investments of the Group are fair valued based on 
Level 1 or Level 2 inputs. These investments primarily include 
investment in liquid mutual fund units, target maturity fund 
units, tax-free bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial 
papers, treasury bills, government securities, non-convertible 
debentures, quoted bonds issued by government and 
quasi-government organizations. The Group invests after 
considering counterparty risks based on multiple criteria 
including Tier I capital, Capital Adequacy Ratio, Credit Rating, 
Profitability, NPA levels and Deposit base of banks and financial 
institutions. These risks are monitored regularly as per Group's 
risk management program.

Financial risk management
Financial risk factors
The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: 
market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's primary 

focus is to foresee the unpredictability of financial markets 
and seek to minimize potential adverse effects on its financial 
performance. The primary market risk to the Group is foreign 
exchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments 
to mitigate foreign exchange related risk exposures. The Group's 
exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual 
characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk 
from the top few customers.

Market risk
The Group operates internationally and a major portion of the 
business is transacted in several currencies and consequently 
the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its sales 
and services in the United States and elsewhere, and purchases 
from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The Group 
holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange 
forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes 
in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is 
also exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany 
transaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between 
the Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed 
substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in 
the future. Consequently, the results of the Group’s operations 
are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates / depreciates 
against these currencies.

Derivative financial instruments
The Group holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward and option contracts to mitigate the risk of changes 
in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank. These derivative financial 
instruments are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are directly or indirectly 
observable in the marketplace.

instruments not designated as cash flow hedges which are

Total  28,817  27,641

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the 
Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward and 
option contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of 
foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash 
transactions. The related hedge transactions for balance in cash 
flow hedges as of March 31, 2024 are expected to occur and will 
be reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
within three months.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based 
on the currency, amount and timing of its forecasted cash flows. 
Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge 
relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness 
assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists 

between the hedged item and hedging instrument, including 
whether the hedging instrument is expected to offset changes in 
cash flows of hedged items.

If the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer 
optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged 
and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the 
hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the 
volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged 
item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk 
management purposes. Any hedge ineffectiveness is calculated 
and accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and 
Loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.

The reconciliation of cash flow hedge reserve for the year ended 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 329

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by 
the counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum 
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily 
from trade receivables amounting to ₹30,193 crore and ₹25,424 
crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively and 
unbilled revenues amounting to ₹14,548 crore and ₹16,738 crore 
as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively. Trade 
receivables and unbilled revenues are typically unsecured and 
are derived from revenues from customers primarily located 
in the United States of America. Credit risk has always been 
managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing 
credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of 
customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal 
course of business. The Group uses the expected credit loss 
model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision 
matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for 
trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into 
account credit reports and other related credit information to 
the extent available.

The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly 
by the individual characteristic of each customer and the 
concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure 
to customers is diversified and there is no single customer 
contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables 
and unbilled revenues.

The details in respect of percentage of revenues generated from 
top five customers and top ten customers is as follows :

The Group’s credit period generally ranges from 30-75 days.

The allowance for lifetime ECL on customer balances for the year

Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group 
generally invest in deposits with banks with high ratings

As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 2,91,795 and 2,24,924 cash-settled options were outstanding, respectively. The carrying value of 
liability towards cash-settled, share-based payments was ₹13 crore and ₹4 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.

The fair value of the awards are estimated using the Black-Scholes Model for time and non-market performance-based options and 
Monte Carlo simulation model is used for TSR-based options.

The inputs to the model include the share price at date of grant, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends, expected 
term and the risk free rate of interest. Expected volatility during the expected term of the options is based on historical volatility of 
the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the 
options. Expected volatility of the comparative company have been modelled based on historical movements in the market prices of 
their publicly traded equity shares during a period equivalent to the expected term of the options. Correlation coefficient is calculated 
between each peer entity and the indices as a whole or between each entity in the peer group.

The fair value of each equity-settled award is estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions :

arrangements with a third party for these assets. As at March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023, the financial liability pertaining to such arrangements 
amounts to ₹372 crore and ₹731 crore, respectively. For the year ended

2.16 Provisions
Accounting policy
A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group 
has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably 
estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are 
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a 
pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

a. Post-sales client support

The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post-sales 
support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs 
associated with such support services are accrued at the time 
related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs 
based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on 
a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and 
likelihood of occurrence.

b. Onerous contracts

Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract 
are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future 
obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses, if 
any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which 
such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or 
costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the 
present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating 
the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the 
contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes 
any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues 
and are expected to be utilized over a period of one year.

Provision for post-sales client support and other 
provisions is included in cost of sales in the Consolidated 
Statement of Profit and Loss.

2.17 Income taxes
Accounting policy
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred income 
tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which 
case it is recognized in equity or other comprehensive income. 
Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized 
at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the 
tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 
all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of 
assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial 
statements except when the deferred income tax arises from 
the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a 
transaction that is not a business combination and affects 
neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the 
transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting 
date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that the related tax benefit will be realized.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using 
tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to 
taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences 
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes 

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 339

in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is 
recognized as income or expense in the period that includes 
the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A deferred 
income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profit will be available against which the 
deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. 
Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed 
earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that 
the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in 
the foreseeable future.

The Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities; 
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, where it has a 
legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts 
and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to 
realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Tax 
benefits of deductions earned on exercise of employee 
share options in excess of compensation charged to income 
are credited to equity.

The applicable Indian corporate statutory tax rate for the years 
ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 34.94% each.

Income tax expense for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 includes reversal (net of provisions) of ₹937 
crore and ₹106 crore, respectively. These reversals pertaining to 
prior periods are primarily on account of adjudication of certain 
disputed matters, upon filing of tax return and completion of 
assessments, across various jurisdictions.

During the year ended March 31, 2024, the Company received 
orders under Sections 250 and 254 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, 
from the Income Tax Authorities in India for the assessment 
years, 2007-08 to 2015-16, 2017-18 and 2018-19. These orders 
confirmed the Company's position with respect to tax treatment 
of certain contentious matters. As a result, interest income (pre-
tax) of ₹1,933 crore was recognized and provision for income 
tax aggregating ₹525 crore was reversed with a corresponding 
credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, upon resolution 
of the disputes, an amount aggregating to ₹1,628 crore has been 
reduced from contingent liabilities.

The foreign tax expense is due to income taxes payable overseas 
principally in the United States. In India, the Group has benefited 
from certain tax incentives that the Government of India had 
provided for export of software and services from the units 
registered under the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 2005. 
SEZ units which began the provision of services on or after April 
1, 2005 are eligible for a deduction of 100% of profits or gains 
derived from the export of services for the first five years from 
the financial year in which the unit commenced the provision 
of services and 50% of such profits or gains for further five 
years. Up to 50% of such profits or gains is also available for 
a further five years subject to creation of a Special Economic 
Zone re-Investment Reserve out of the profit of the eligible SEZ 
units and utilization of such reserve by the Group for acquiring 
new plant and machinery for the purpose of its business as per 
the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961. (Refer to Special 
Economic Zone Re-investment reserve under Note 2.12 Equity)

Deferred income tax for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 substantially relates to origination and reversal of 
temporary differences.

Infosys is subject to a 15% Branch Profit Tax (BPT) in the US to 
the extent its US branch's net profit during the year is greater 
than the increase in the net assets of the US branch during the 
year, computed in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. 
As at March 31, 2024, Infosys' US branch net assets amounted to 
approximately ₹7,844 crore. As at March 31, 2024, the Company 
has a deferred tax liability for Branch Profit Tax of ₹269 crore (net 
of credits), as the Company estimates that these branch profits 
are expected to be distributed in the foreseeable future

Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognized on 
temporary differences amounting to ₹10,776 crore and ₹10,948 
crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively, 
associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches as 
the Company is able to control the timing of reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24340

The Group majorly intends to repatriate earnings from 
subsidiaries and branches only to the extent these can be 
distributed in a tax free manner.

Deferred income tax assets have not been recognized on 
accumulated losses of ₹4,668 crore and ₹4,423 crore as at March 
31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively, as it is probable that 
future taxable profit will not be available against which the 
unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future.

In assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the 
management considers whether some portion or all of the 
deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon 
the generation of future taxable income during the periods 
in which the temporary differences become deductible. The 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred 
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax 
planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level 
of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable 
income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets 
are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will 
realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount 
of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, 
could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable 
income during the carry forward period are reduced.

The Company’s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired 
in March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and 
currently the US taxable income is based on the Company’s best 
estimate determined based on the expected value method.

2.18 Revenue from operations
Accounting policy
The Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising 
software development and related services, cloud and 
infrastructure services, maintenance, consulting and package 
implementation, licensing of software products and platforms 
across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as 
“software-related services”) and business process management 
services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-
material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for 
recognition and measurement when the contract has been 
approved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to 
contract are committed to perform their respective obligations 
under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. 
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised 
products or services (“performance obligations”) to customers 
in an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has 
received or expects to receive in exchange for these products 
or services (“transaction price”). When there is uncertainty as 
to collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such 
uncertainty is resolved.

The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and 
identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. 
The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct 
performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling 

price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold 
separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. 
In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to 
estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a 
margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying 
the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate 
margin based on similar services.

The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration 
including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group 
includes variable consideration as part of transaction price 
when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of 
the variable consideration and when it is probable that a 
significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will 
not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable 
consideration is resolved.

Revenue on time-and-material and unit of work based contracts, 
are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-
line basis when services are performed through an indefinite 
number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably 
using a percentage of completion method when the pattern 
of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and 
the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the 
period of contract because the services are generally discrete 
in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, 
fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations 
are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to 
determine progress towards completion as there is a direct 
relationship between input and productivity. Progress towards 
completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to 
date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs 
or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts 
are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and 
are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates 
change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the 
estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the 
contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on 
incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such 
losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs 
to complete the contract.

The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic 
performance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress 
billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled 
revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as 
contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).

In arrangements for software development and related 
services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue 
recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, 
the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria 
for considering software development and related services as 
distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction 
price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each 
performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone 
selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item 
when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone 
selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine 
the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost

plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling 
price. For software development and related services, the 
performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services 
are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the 
work as it progresses.

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include 
multiple elements which may be subject to other specific 
accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts 
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting 
guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to 
determine that hardware and services are distinct performance 
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance 
obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the 
absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected 
cost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone 
selling price. When such arrangements are considered as a 
single performance obligation, revenue is recognized over 
the period and measure of progress is determined based on 
promise in the contract.

Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a “right 
to use” the licenses is recognized at the time the license 
are made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses 
where the customer obtains a “right to access” is recognized 
over the access period.

Arrangements to deliver software products generally have 
three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical 
Services (ATS). When implementation services are provided in 
conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license 
and implementation have been identified as two distinct 
separate performance obligations, the transaction price for 
such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of 
the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. 
In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, 
the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in 
estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license 
is required to be substantially customized as part of the 
implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license 
and implementation is considered to be a single performance 
obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-
of-completion method as the implementation is performed. 
Revenue from client training, support and other services arising 
due to the sale of software products is recognized as the 
performance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized 
ratably on a straight-line basis over the period in which the 
services are rendered.

Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or 
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated 
services arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue 
from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded 
net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between 
the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is 
the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first 
evaluates whether it obtains control of the specified goods or 
services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group 
considers whether it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the 
promise to provide the specified goods or services, inventory 
risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it 
controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting 
as a principal or an agent.

A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both 
of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. 
A contract modification that results in the addition of distinct 
performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate 
contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone 
selling price or as a termination of the existing contract and 
creation of a new contract if they are not priced at the standalone 
selling price. If the modification does not result in a distinct 
performance obligation, it is accounted for as part of the existing 
contract on a cumulative catch-up basis.

The incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs 
that would not have been incurred if the contract had not 
been obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group 
expects to recover them.

Certain eligible, non-recurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition 
or transformation costs) that do not represent a separate 
performance obligation are recognized as an asset when 
such costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate 
or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in 
satisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are 
expected to be recovered.

Capitalized contract costs relating to upfront payments to 
customers are amortized to revenue and other capitalized costs 
are amortized to expenses over the respective contract life 
on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or 
services to customer to which the asset relates. Capitalized costs 
are monitored regularly for impairment. Impairment losses are 
recorded when present value of projected remaining operating 
cash flows is not sufficient to recover the carrying amount of 
the capitalized costs.

The Group presents revenues net of indirect taxes in its 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Revenue from operations for the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023 is as follows :

(In ₹ crore)

Particulars Year ended March 31,

Revenue from products and platforms  8,385  9,192

Total revenue from operations  153,670  146,767

Products and platforms

The Group also derives revenues from the sale of products and 
platforms including Finacle® – core banking solution, Edge Suite 
of products, Panaya platform, Infosys Equinox, Infosys Helix, 
Infosys Applied AI, Infosys Cortex, Stater digital platform and 
Infosys McCamish – insurance platform.

Disaggregated revenue information

Revenue disaggregation by business segments has been 
included in segment information (Refer to Note 2.26). The table 
below presents disaggregated revenues from contracts with 
customers by geography and contract type. The Group believes 
that this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, 
timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected 
by industry, market and other economic factors.

* Geographical revenue is based on the domicile of customer

The percentage of revenue from fixed-price contracts for 
each of the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is 
approximately 53% and 52%, respectively.

Trade receivables and contract balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections 
results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue 
on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts are billed 
as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual 
terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or 
upon achievement of contractual milestones.

The Group’s receivables are rights to consideration that are 
unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess 
of billings from time and material contracts and fixed-price 
maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when 
the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only 
after a passage of time.

Invoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based on 
milestones as defined in the contract and therefore the timing of 
revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to 
the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price 
contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset 
because the right to consideration is dependent on completion 
of contractual milestones.

Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.

Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of 
impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the 
Company recognized revenue of ₹5,432 crore and ₹5,387 crore 
arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2023 and 
April 1, 2022, respectively.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 
₹7,023 crore and ₹5,950 crore of unbilled revenue pertaining 
to other fixed-price and fixed-time frame contracts as 
of April 1, 2023 and April 1, 2022, respectively has been 
reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on 
completion of milestones.

Remaining performance obligation disclosure
The remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the 
aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized 
as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to 

when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. 
Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the 
Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation 
related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized 
corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the 
entity's performance completed to date, typically those contracts 
where invoicing is on time and material and unit of work-based 
contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are 
subject to change and are affected by several factors, including 
terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic 
revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized 
and adjustments for currency fluctuations.

The aggregate value of performance obligations that are 
completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2024, other 
than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, 
is ₹90,658 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize 
revenue of around 53.0% within the next one year and the 
remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance 
obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at 
March 31, 2023 was ₹80,867 crore. The contracts can generally 
be terminated by the customers and typically includes an 
enforceable termination penalty payable by them. Generally, 
customers have not terminated contracts without cause.

2.19 Other income, net
Accounting policy
Other income is comprised primarily of interest income, dividend 
income, gain / loss on investment and exchange gain / loss on 
forward and options contracts and on translation of foreign 
currency assets and liabilities. Interest income is recognized using 
the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognized 
when the right to receive payment is established.

Foreign currency – Accounting policy
Functional currency

The functional currency of Infosys, Infosys BPM, EdgeVerve, 
Skava, Infosys Green Forum, Danske IT and controlled trusts is the 
Indian rupee. The functional currencies for foreign subsidiaries 
are their respective local currencies. These financial statements 
are presented in Indian rupees (rounded off to crore; one crore 
equals ten million).

Transactions and translations

Foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
are translated into the relevant functional currency at 
exchange rates in effect at the Balance Sheet date. The gains 
or losses resulting from such translations are recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and reported 
within exchange gains / (losses) on translation of assets and 
liabilities, net, except when deferred in Other Comprehensive 
Income as qualifying cash flow hedges. Non-monetary assets 
and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
and measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate 
prevalent at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-
monetary assets and non-monetary liabilities denominated in a 
foreign currency and measured at historical cost are translated 
at the exchange rate prevalent at the date of transaction. 
The related revenue and expense are recognized using 
the same exchange rate.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 345

Transaction gains or losses realized upon settlement of foreign 
currency transactions are included in determining net profit 
for the period in which the transaction is settled. Revenue, 
expense and cash-flow items denominated in foreign currencies 
are translated into the relevant functional currencies using the 
exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction.

The translation of financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries 
to the presentation currency is performed for assets and liabilities 
using the exchange rate in effect at the Balance Sheet date and for 
revenue, expense and cash-flow items using the average exchange 
rate for the respective periods. The gains or losses resulting from 
such translation are included in currency translation reserves 
under other components of equity. When a subsidiary is disposed 
off, in full, the relevant amount is transferred to net profit in the 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. However when a change 
in the parent's ownership does not result in loss of control of a 
subsidiary, such changes are recorded through equity.

Other Comprehensive Income, net of taxes includes translation 
differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at 
fair value at the reporting date, such as equities classified as 
financial instruments and measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI).

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate in effect at 
the Balance Sheet date.

Government grant

The Group recognizes government grants only when there is 
reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will 
be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government 
grants related to assets are treated as deferred income and are 
recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit 
and Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful life of 
the asset. Government grants related to revenue are recognized 
on a systematic basis in net profit in the consolidated Statement of 
Profit and Loss over the periods necessary to match them with the 
related costs which they are intended to compensate.

2.21 Leases 
Accounting policy
The Group as a lessee
The Group’s lease asset classes primarily consist of leases for 
land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a 
contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract 
is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control 
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for 
consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to 
control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: 
(1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group 
has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset 
through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to 
direct the use of the asset.

At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes 
a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability 
for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases 
with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low 
value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Group 
recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a 
straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

As a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-
cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or 
terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. 
The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a 
lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably 
certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract 
will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company 
considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements 
undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination 
of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Group’s 
operations taking into account the location of the underlying 
asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in 
future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects 
the current economic circumstances.

Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or 
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets 
and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably 
certain that they will be exercised.

The ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises 
the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease 
payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the 
lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They 
are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation 
and impairment losses.

The ROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date on 
a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful 
life of the underlying asset.

The ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts 
may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, 
the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost 
to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset 
basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the 
recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit 
(CGU) to which the asset belongs.

The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the 
present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments 
are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not 
readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the 
country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured 
with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset 
if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an 
extension or a termination option.

Lease liability and ROU assets have been separately presented 
in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as 
financing cash flows.

The Group as a lessor
Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially 
all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified 
as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified 
as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

2.22 Employee benefits
Accounting policy
Gratuity and pensions

The Group provides for gratuity, a defined benefit retirement 
plan ("the Gratuity Plan") covering eligible employees majorly of 
Infosys and its Indian subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a 
lump-sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, 
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an amount 
based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of 
employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity 
liabilities to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust 
("the Trust"). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions 
are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust 
and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust, 
respectively. Trustees administer contributions made to the 
Trusts and contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life 
Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

The Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain 
overseas jurisdictions, in accordance with the local laws. 
These plans are managed by third party fund managers. The 
plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and / or a 
lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes 
death and disability benefits. The defined benefit plans require 
contributions which are based on a percentage of salary that 
varies depending on the age of the respective employees.

Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are 
determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external 
actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using the projected 
unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the 
Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate 
risk and market risk.

The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit 
plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses 
through re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability 
/ (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and 
are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The 
actual return of the portfolio of plan assets, in excess of the yields 
computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the 
defined benefit obligation is recognized in other comprehensive 
income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net 
profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.

Provident fund

Eligible employees of Infosys receive benefits from a provident 
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee 
and the Company make monthly contributions to the provident 
fund plan equal to a specified percentage of the covered 
employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the 
Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust 
invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian 
law. The remaining portion is contributed to the government 

administered pension fund. The rate at which the annual interest 
is payable to the beneficiaries by the trust is being administered 
by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation 
to make good the shortfall, if any, between the return from the 
investments of the trust and the notified interest rate.

In respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive 
benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution 
plan. Both the eligible employee and the respective companies 
make monthly contributions to this provident fund plan 
equal to a specified percentage of the covered employee's 
salary. Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are 
deposited in a government administered provident fund. The 
Companies have no further obligation to the plan beyond its 
monthly contributions.

Superannuation

Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are 
participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no 
further obligations to the plan beyond its monthly contributions 
which are periodically contributed to a trust fund, the corpus of 
which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

Compensated absences

The Group has a policy on compensated absences which 
are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The 
expected cost of accumulating compensated absences is 
determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external 
actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit 
method on the additional amount expected to be paid / availed 
as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the 
Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-accumulating compensated 
absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.

Weighted average rate of increase

(1) For domestic defined benefit plan in India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not developed, the yield of government bonds is considered 
as the discount rate. For most of our overseas defined benefit plan, given that the market for high quality corporate bonds is not developed, the Government 
bond rate adjusted for corporate spreads is used.

(2) The average rate of increase in compensation levels is determined by the Company, considering factors such as, the Company’s past compensation revision 
trends, inflation in respective markets and management’s estimate of future salary increases.

(3) Attrition rate considered is the Management’s estimate based on the past long-term trend of employee turnover in the Company. The tenure has been 
considered taking into account the past long-term trend of employees' average remaining service life which reflects the average estimated term of post-
employment benefit obligation.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 351

For domestic defined benefit plan in India, assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance 
with the published statistics by the Life Insurance Corporation 
of India. For overseas defined benefit plan, the assumptions 
regarding future mortality experience are set with regard to 
the latest statistics in life expectancy, plan experience and 
other relevant data.

The Group assesses all of the above assumptions 
with its projected long-term plans of growth and 
prevalent industry standards.

The Company contributes all ascertained liabilities towards 
gratuity to the Infosys Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust. 
In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to 
the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust and EdgeVerve 
Systems Limited Employees Gratuity Fund Trust, respectively. 
Trustees administer contributions made to the trust as at March 
31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, and contributions for gratuity are 
invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of 
India as permitted by Indian law. The plan assets of the overseas 
defined benefit plan have been primarily invested in insurer 
managed funds and the asset allocation for plan assets is 
determined based on the investment criteria prescribed under 
the relevant regulations applicable to pension funds and the 
insurer managers. The insurers' investment are diversified and 
provide for guaranteed interest rates arrangements.

Actual return on assets (including remeasurements) of the 
gratuity plan for the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 
2023 were ₹145 crore and ₹129 crore, respectively and for the 
pension plan were ₹36 crore and ₹(91) crore, respectively.

The contributions for gratuity are invested in a scheme with the 
Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.

March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows :

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risk 
which are set out below:

Interest rate risk: The present value of the defined benefit plan 
liability is generally calculated using a discount rate determined 
by reference to government bond yields and in certain overseas 
jurisdictions, it is calculated in reference to government bond 
yield adjusted for a corporate spread. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

Life expectancy and investment risk: The pension fund 
offers the choice between a lifelong pension and a cash lump 

sum upon retirement. The pension fund has defined rates for 
converting the lump sum to a pension and there is the risk that 
the members live longer than implied by these conversion rates 
and that the pension assets don’t achieve the investment return 
implied by these conversion rates.

Asset volatility: A proportion of the pension fund is held in 
equities, which is expected to outperform corporate bonds 
in the long term but give exposure to volatility and risk in the 
short term. The pension fund board of insurer is responsible 
for the investment strategy and equity allocation is justified 
given the long-term investment horizon of the pension fund 
and the objective to provide a reasonable long term return on 
members’ account balances.

The sensitivity of significant assumptions used for valuation of 
defined benefit obligation is as follows :

(In ₹ crore)

Impact from As at March 31, 2024

1% point

decrease

0.5% point 
increase / 
decrease

Discount rate 112  43

Weighted average rate of increase in 
compensation levels  103  7

Sensitivity to significant actuarial assumptions is computed 
by varying one actuarial assumption used for the valuation of 
the defined benefit obligation and keeping all other actuarial 
assumptions constant. In practice, this is not probable, and 
changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The Group expects to contribute ₹335 crore to gratuity and 
₹45 crore to pension during the fiscal 2025.

The maturity profile of defined benefit obligation is as follows :

2.22.2 Provident fund
Infosys has an obligation to fund any shortfall on the yield of 
the trust’s investments over the administered interest rates 
on an annual basis. These administered rates are determined 
annually predominantly considering the social rather than 
economic factors. The actuary has provided a valuation for 
provident fund liabilities on the basis of guidance issued by the 
Actuarial Society of India.

(1)  In India, the market for high quality corporate bonds being not 
developed, the yield of government bonds is considered as the discount 
rate. The tenure has been considered taking into account the past long-
term trend of employees’ average remaining service life which reflects the 
average estimated term of the post-employment benefit obligations.

The break-up of the plan assets into various categories as at 
March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 is as follows :

The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on the 
investment criteria prescribed under the relevant regulations.
The actuarial valuation of PF liability exposes the Group to 
interest rate risk. The defined benefit obligation calculated uses a 
discount rate based on government bonds. If bond yields fall, the 
defined benefit obligation will tend to increase.

As at March 31, 2024, the defined benefit obligation would 
be affected by approximately ₹66 crore and ₹110 crore on 
account of a 0.25% increase / decrease in the expected rate of 
return on plan assets.

The Group contributed ₹1,257 crore and ₹1,193 crore to the 
provident fund during the year ended March 31, 2024 and 
March 31, 2023, respectively. The same has been recognized in 
the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under the head 
employee benefit expense.

The provident plans are applicable only to employees drawing a 
salary in Indian rupees.

2.23 Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares used in 
computing earnings per equity share
Accounting policy
Basic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net 
profit attributable to the equity holders of the Group by the 
weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by 
dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of 
the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares 
considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also 
the weighted average number of equity shares that could have 
been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity 
shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the 
proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at 
fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity 
shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted 
as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. 
Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently 
for each period presented.

The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity 
shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for 
any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes 
effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by 
the Board of Directors.

A reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of 
basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows :

Particulars Year ended March 31,

2024 2023

Basic earnings per equity share 
– weighted average number of 
equity shares outstanding(1)  413,85,68,090  418,08,97,857

For the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, there 
were 1,19,711 and 9,960 options to purchase equity shares which 
had an anti-dilutive effect.

2.24 Contingent liabilities and commitments
Accounting policy
Contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past 
events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the 
occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future 
events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present 
obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized 
because it is not probable that an outflow of resources 
embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured 
with sufficient reliability.

acknowledged as debts in respect of income tax matters amounted to 
₹2,794 crore and ₹4,062 crore, respectively.

 The claims against the Group primarily represent demands arising on 
completion of assessment proceedings under the Income-tax Act, 1961. 
These claims are on account of issues of disallowance of expenditure 
towards software being held as capital in nature, payments made to 
associated enterprises held as liable for withholding of taxes, among 
others. These matters are pending before various Income tax Authorities 
and the Management including its tax advisors expect that its position 
will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material 
adverse effect on the Group's financial position and results of operations.

 Amount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims amounted 
to ₹8,743 crore and ₹6,528 crore as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, 
respectively.

2.24.2 McCamish Cybersecurity incident
In November 2023, Infosys McCamish Systems (McCamish), 
a step-down subsidiary of Infosys Limited, experienced a 
cybersecurity incident resulting in the non-availability of certain 
applications and systems. McCamish initiated its incident 
response and engaged cybersecurity and other specialists 
to assist in its investigation of and response to the incident 
and remediation and restoration of impacted applications 
and systems. By December 31, 2023, McCamish, with external 
specialists’ assistance, substantially remediated and restored the 
affected applications and systems.

Loss of contracted revenues and costs incurred with respect to 
remediations, restoration, communication efforts, investigative 
processes and analysis, legal services and others amounted to 
$38 million (approximately ₹316 crore).

Actions taken by McCamish included investigative analysis 
conducted by a third-party cybersecurity firm to determine, 
among other things, whether and the extent to which company 
or customer data was subject to unauthorized access or 
exfiltration. McCamish also engaged a third-party eDiscovery 
vendor in assessing the extent and nature of such data. 
McCamish in coordination with its third-party eDiscovery vendor 
has identified corporate customers and individuals whose 
information was subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration. 
McCamish’s review process is ongoing. McCamish may incur 
additional costs including indemnities or damages / claims, 
which are indeterminable at this time.

On March 6, 2024, a class action complaint was filed in the 
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against 
McCamish . The complaint arises out of the cybersecurity 
incident at McCamish initially disclosed on November 3, 2023. 
The complaint was purportedly filed on behalf of all individuals 
within the United States whose personally identifiable 
information was exposed to unauthorized third parties as a 
result of the incident.

2.24.3 Legal proceedings
Apart from this, the Group is subject to legal proceedings and 
claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The 
Group’s management reasonably expects that such ordinary 
course legal actions, when ultimately concluded and determined, 
will not have a material and adverse effect on the Group’s results 
of operations or financial condition.

Consolidated Financial Statements



Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 363

2.26 Segment reporting
Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating 
segments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations 
predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief 
Operating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various 
performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting 
principles used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual 
segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.

Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises 
in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in 
Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The 
Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle operating 
segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of businesses in 
India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services.

Revenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable 
to that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from 
customers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses 
incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized 
in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant 
component of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The 
Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these 
expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.

Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably 
between segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets 
and liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.

Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is 
otherwise recognized.

Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.

Notes
1. Pursuant to the General Circular No. 09/2023 dated September 25, 2023, issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and 

Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2023/167 dated October 7, 2023 issued by SEBI (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the 
Circulars”), companies are allowed to hold AGM through VC, without the physical presence of members at a common venue. Hence, 
in compliance with the Circulars, the AGM of the Company is being held through VC.

2. A member entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend and vote on his / her behalf and the proxy 
need not be a member of the Company. Since the AGM is being held in accordance with the Circulars through VC, the facility for the 
appointment of proxies by the members will not be available.

3. Participation of members through VC will be reckoned for the purpose of quorum for the AGM as per Section 103 of the Act.
4. Corporate members intending to authorize their representatives to participate and vote at the meeting are requested to send a

Infosys Limited Notice of the 43rd Annual General Meeting | 3

6. Members whose shareholding is in demat mode are requested to notify any change in address or bank account details to their 
respective depository participant(s) (DP). Members whose shareholding is in physical mode are requested to opt for the Electronic 
Clearing System (ECS) mode to receive dividend on time in line with the Circulars. We urge members to utilize the ECS for receiving 
dividends. Please refer to point no. 16 for the process to be followed for updating bank account details.

7. Members may note that the Board, at its meeting held on April 18, 2024, has recommended a final dividend of ₹20/- per equity 
share for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and additionally a special dividend of ₹8/- per equity share. The record date for 
the purpose of final dividend and special dividend is May 31, 2024. The final dividend and special dividend, once approved by the 
members in the ensuing AGM, will be paid on July 1, 2024, through various modes. To avoid delay in receiving dividend, members 
are requested to update their KYC with their depositories (where shares are held in dematerialized mode) and with the Company’s 
Registrar and Transfer Agent (RTA) (where shares are held in physical mode) to receive the dividend directly into their bank account 
on the payout date.

8. Members may note that the Income-tax Act, 1961, (“the IT Act”) as amended by the Finance Act, 2020, mandates that dividend paid 
or distributed by a company on or after April 1, 2020 shall be taxable in the hands of members. The Company shall therefore be 
required to deduct tax at source (TDS) at the time of making the payment of final and special dividend. To enable us to determine the 
appropriate TDS rate as applicable, members are requested to submit relevant documents, as specified in the below paragraphs, in 
accordance with the provisions of the IT Act.

For resident shareholders, taxes shall be deducted at source under Section 194 of the IT Act as follows:

Members having valid Permanent Account Number (PAN) 10%* or as notified by the Government of India (GOI)

Members not having PAN / valid PAN 20% or as notified by the GOI

*i) As per the Finance Act, 2021, Section 206AB has been inserted effective July 1, 2021, wherein higher rate of tax (twice the specified rate) would be 
applicable on payment made to a shareholder who is classified as ‘Specified Person’ as defined under Section 206AB of the Finance Act, 2021.

ii) As per Section 139AA of the IT Act, every person who has been allotted a PAN and who is eligible to obtain Aadhaar, shall be required to link the PAN with 
Aadhaar. In case of failure to comply with this, the PAN allotted shall be deemed to be invalid / inoperative and he shall be liable to all consequences under 
the IT Act and tax shall be deducted at the higher rates as prescribed under the IT Act.

However, no tax shall be deducted on the dividend payable to resident individual shareholders if the total dividend to be received by 
them during financial year 2024-25 does not exceed ₹5,000, and also in cases where members provide Form 15G / Form 15H (Form 
15H is applicable to resident individual shareholders aged 60 years or more), subject to conditions specified in the IT Act. Resident 
shareholders may also submit any other document as prescribed under the IT Act to claim a lower / nil withholding of tax. PAN is 
mandatory for members providing Form 15G / 15H or any other document as mentioned above.

For non-resident shareholders, taxes are required to be withheld in accordance with the provisions of Section 195 and other 
applicable sections of the IT Act, at the rates in force. The withholding tax shall be at the rate of 20%** (plus applicable surcharge 
and cess) or as notified by the GOI on the amount of dividend payable. However, as per Section 90 of the IT Act, non-resident 
shareholders have the option to be governed by the provisions of the Double Tax Avoidance Agreement (DTAA), read with 
Multilateral Instrument (MLI) between India and the country of tax residence of the shareholders, if they are more beneficial to them. 
For this purpose, i.e. to avail the benefits under the DTAA read with MLI, non-resident shareholders will have to provide the following:

•  Copy of the PAN card allotted by the Indian income tax authorities duly attested by the shareholders or details as prescribed 
under rule 37BC of the Income-tax Rules, 1962

•  Copy of the Tax Residency Certificate for financial year 2023-24 obtained from the revenue or tax authorities of the country of tax 
residence, duly attested by shareholders

•  Electronic Form 10F as per notification no. 03/2022 dated July 16, 2022 issued by the Central Board of Direct Tax [Notification can 
be read under notification-no-3-2022-systems.pdf (incometaxindia.gov.in)]. Form 10F can be obtained electronically through the 
e-filing portal of the income tax website at https://www.incometax.gov.in/iec/foportal

•  Self-declaration by the shareholders of having no permanent establishment in India in accordance with the applicable tax treaty
•  Self-declaration of beneficial ownership by the non-resident shareholder
•  Any other documents as prescribed under the IT Act for lower withholding of taxes, if applicable, duly attested by the 

shareholders

In case of Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) / Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI), tax will be deducted under Section 196D of the IT Act 
at the rate of 20%** (plus applicable surcharge and cess) or the rate provided in relevant DTAA, read with MLI, whichever is more 
beneficial, subject to the submission of the above documents, if applicable.

** As per the Finance Act, 2021, Section 206AB has been inserted effective July 1, 2021, wherein the higher rate of tax (twice the specified rate) would be 
applicable on payment made to a shareholder who is classified as ‘Specified Person’ as defined under the provisions of the aforesaid Section. However, in 
case of a non-resident shareholder or a non-resident FPI / FII, the higher rate of tax as mentioned in Section 206AB shall not apply if such non-resident does 
not have a permanent establishment in India.

The aforementioned documents are required to be uploaded on the shareholder portal at https://www.infosys.com/investors/
